Let's go!

[Verse 1]
It's not easy making a name for yourself
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far
Let's have some fun and never change up for anyone
Try not to miss me when I'm gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, oh, woah, oh
I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone!

[Chorus]
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna need you to try to follow along
I did the best that I could to try to write you songs
Now go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed
I write what I feel, I say what I mean, you can't buy sincerity
[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, oh, woah, oh
I sold my soul to the open road
I'll live my life alone!

[Chorus]
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
This town will be the downfall of us all

[Bridge]
Don't forget yourselves, we made up our minds
Yeah, we signed three, four, five on that dotted line
Don't forget yourselves, we made up our minds
Yeah, we signed three, four, five on that dotted line

[Chorus]
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong
You won't find me in the same spot, believe me
I could never stop, my life's turned upside down
Meet me out past the train tracks, I'm leaving
And not coming back, you're right, and I was wrong

Across the street from the health department
She left her pills in the glove compartment

So now I’m dreamin, not dealing with the flood
Goodbye gravity

(Hip hip hooray for the elephants on parade)

[Verse 1]
Take the gist of it and twist it
'Til it makes you smile
And don't be scared if there's a snare
Sometimes it takes a while
There's much to learn from every turn inside a labyrinth
Don't you try to think about it
No way to talk about it
And I will ever change and never cease to be amazed
Air bubbles up and overflows and then it goes away
I want to hold and nurture every second of this life that has been given to me

You're preaching to the chorus

I got the feeling that I wanna be alone with you
And I got the feeling that you
Might want to be alone with me too
Take a finger and snap, just like that
And I had to say hey baby let's go
And make it home for our show
Simple defragmentation gets us to the point at last
But no relaxing 'til they give us all our memory back
Touché but they had the wherewithal to take it all out of order anyway
They can always make you pay up

I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out

Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

"[Verse 1]
In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction
I wrapped a hand around its stem
I pulled until the roots gave in
Finding there what I'd been missing

But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

[Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

[Verse 2]
Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now
I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live. I walked away now
But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

[Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

All because of you...
All because of you...

[Extended Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
Inside these arms of yours

All because of you
I believe in angels
Not the kind with wings
No, not the kind with halos
The kind that bring you home
When home becomes a strange place
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

I can remember the days in my life
When my future looked bright
Back before mom had died
Before I heard dad coughing up blood in his room
And the doctor said ""Son, he'll be joining her soon""
And then everything changed
What was bright turned to bleak
'Cause everyone seemed to get sick, 'cept for me
And my dad's final cough, where they carted me off
They stuck me in hell and they gave me a cross

[Chorus]
And said ""Son, the church is all you've got now, got now, son
So give your life to God now, God
My son, I know you're scared, I know you're young
Just say your prayers tonight
'Cause nobody's gonna come
'Cause no one loves an orphan""

"[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
(This happened to you)

[Verse 2]
It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure

You made it through but nevertheless
I got you out on a wire

Tell it all and fill up the air

Stop, turn, take a look around

Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down

Make it new but stay in the lines
Just let go but keep it inside
Smile big for everyone

They gave you the end but not where to start
Not how to build, how to tear it apart

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Chorus]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985, 1985

[Verse 2]
She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows on the radio?
[Chorus]
On the radio was Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985

She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock? (Classic rock)
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, STOP!

There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV

Deserve to be annihilated

When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

When I'm alone with my great plans
And this is what she said gets her through it
""If I don't let myself be happy now, then when?
If not now, when?""

Born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
Where no one understands me
When I finally met an angel, I didn't know what to say
She just held my hand
And we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars
Thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are
When we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
Then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
So why do we hurt each other?
We don't need the words for one another's

Prayers, they don't mean a thing at all
Do they answer when you call?
These prayers, when you don't mean what you say
Would you die for me today? Now I just can't relate

None of this makes sense in this reality
God just leaves the room when I turn on my TV
I see a little girl who's crying 'cause she lost her family
All these strangers sending thoughts and prayers, she's buried underneath

Why do we kill each other?
We can't feel the pain in one another's

If there's one thing that makes me sick
It's when someone tries to hide behind politics
I wish that time could go by fast
Somehow they manage to make it last

"[Verse 1]
He said, ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say, if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid""
I said, ""That sounds pretty good""
Black leather boots, spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair, but it looks alright
We marched and we sang, we all became friends
As we learned how to fight

[Chorus 1]
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

[Verse 2]
I kicked in the door, I yelled my commands
The children, they cried, but I got my man
We took him away, a bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes, they pissed in his hands
I told them to stop, but then I joined in
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once
But again and again
[Chorus 1]
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

[Verse 3]
She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop, I begged her to stay
But she pressed on, so I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand that the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

[Chorus 2]
A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

He said, ""Son
Have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say

"[Verse 1]
I met a fox the other day
When I asked how much she cost, I had to pay
All of a sudden I'd brought her home
She's one hundred kilos dressed in silverchrome

She's my world, she's so rad
She's the best ride I ever had
She's my life, she's so bad
She's the best ride I ever had

[Verse 2]
When I imagine me and her
You know that I get a stand-up fur
I give her oil, I give her gas
And get her seat beneath my ass
And then the turtledoves drive away

She's my world, she's so rad
She's the best ride I ever had
She's my life, she's so bad

She's secondhand, so what
She's true, she's by my side
For all I care she's hot
And she's a real good ride
When we go out people stop
And stare with jealous minds
It's OK for me as long as they let her be
To prevent something like a theft
I got her locked 'round a tree

I'm swimming in this kerosene

"[Verse 1]
On a fault line, late night
Underneath the stars we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

[Chorus]
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

[Verse 2]
We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times
[Chorus]
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times

"[Verse 1: Trenton Woodley]
I wonder, can you daydream at night?
Lying awake, I've had too much time
I'm watching picture shows in the shadows
Dance for the crowd tonight
Imagination is such a vivid place to hide
While stars watch over you

[Chorus: Trenton Woodley]
Through silent homes
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
The way I've walked before
Sleeping with saints and apparitions between the walls
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
I promised not to wake you
So I'll walk light, just so you can hear

[Verse 2: Trenton Woodley]
The rats in the roof and termites in the ceiling
We'll hear everything except what we need to hear
Sleeplessness is for the restless and I'm just fine
Left to wander, aimless in unconsciousness
There's spiders crawling from the corners of my eyes
(Let them weave their little webs)
(To snatch the sunlight from the lens)
I'm staring at the ceiling cause I'm fed up with the sight
(Weigh my eyelids back to sleep, sealed by silken silver threads)
While stars watch over you
[Chorus: Trenton Woodley]
Through silent homes
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
The way I've walked before
Sleeping with saints and apparitions between the walls
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
Cast the sheep out of your mind
Count the wolves and we'll sleep tonight

[Verse 3: Tyler Carter & Jonny Craig]
I stumble in and I stumble out
Of unfamiliar rooms in foreign houses, but I'm at home (Foreign houses)
Now a ghost has left behind his sheets
Unrequited, until I wake up somewhere
Until I wake up somewhere I know I've never been

I'll stay 'til sleep takes over you
And I'll walk while stars watch over you

"Some say that nothing lasts forever
But no one knows what happens when you die
So if this is all there is, it’s now or never
Life’s too short to not give it a try
So try your wings, find out if you can fly

I don’t wanna live my life doing stuff I don’t like to do
I just wanna spend my time on creating something true
I don’t wanna live my life just pretending what I’m not
I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot

I’ve spent my last three years in college
As the oldest guy there I got my degree
And I guess it all gave me some kind of knowledge
But anyway I’m still just as naive
Hoping greener grass is still waiting there for me

I don’t wanna live my life doing stuff I don’t like to do
I just wanna spend my time on creating something true
I don’t wanna live my life just pretending what I’m not
I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot

It’s not about the size of any wallet
It’s not about the fortune or the fame
True brew is what we’d like to call it
It’s a freedom both scary and lovely that you want all the same
True brew will always be the aim
I just wanna live for something true
I don’t care if it’s good enough for you
I just wanna create something true

I don’t wanna live my life doing stuff I don’t like to do
I just wanna spend my time on creating something true
I don’t wanna live my life just pretending what I’m not
I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot

This is my true brew, yeah
This is what I do

"I remember when I was told of story of
Crushed velvet, candle wax, and dried up flowers
The figure on the bed all dressed up in roses, calling
Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream

Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me

I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy

Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below

I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy
The girl on the wall always waited for me
And she was always smiling
The teenage death boys, the teenage death girls
And everyone was dancing
Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then
Everyone was dancing

No one could see me

Our dreams seemed not far away

"I got ideas how this planet works
It gives perspective on all the racist jerks
Like in the end, they shed imbalance to everything we know
Some brains are fast, means that some brains are slow

This is the rational side of me, I guess
The sense they barely use when playing chess
Luck's in the end I know there's also the other side of me
And to me it's an emotional sensibility

And that's the side of me I turn to
When I read about the world, well
That's not my cup of tea
Yeah, it's the side of me I take
That tells me you've got it wrong
Well, how clear we disagree

The kind that'd always try to understand
But there's a darker force inside of me that wants me to
Be as bad and be as sad, sad as you

Girls make boys cry, and I...

But your simple toy had caused a scene like this
Leave him hanging on the walls, just a picture in the hall
Like a hundred more (like a hundred more)
Consider this as a gift as you taste him on your lips
And he's making you scream with his hands on your hips
I hope he's leaving you empty baby this is just a fix

"Driver omkring här i linné
Jag söker någon sorts egen livskvalité
Ingen människa ser mig men en dag som den här känns det bra

Jag vet jag måste göra min grej
Spelar ingen roll vad folk säger mig
Det är nu eller aldrig
Det är allt på ett kort
Att det är nu eller aldrig gör steget för stort
Det ser ut som jag får vänta för evigt för att få nånting gjort

När ska jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Göra dom saker jag tror på?
När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar jag vill nå?
Så när kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Mitt liv för mig
För bara mig
Mitt liv för mig

Jag når Örat
Jag kör E20 norr
Det är stan i mitt hjärta av lycka och sorg
Men alla dom drömmar jag har finns ej där
Jag måste ta en chans i mitt liv
Måste på det där tåget innan det går förbi
Men jag förblir passiv
Står kvar där jag är
Fast jag sagt till mig själv: ""jag gör det, jag svär""
Jag vet att det är tragiskt att inte leva så som man lär
När ska jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Göra dom saker jag tror på
När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar jag vill nå?
Så när kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig?

Så säg att du förstår mig
Säg att du känner dig lika liten som jag
Säg att du förstår mig och jag gör det idag

När ska jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Göra dom saker jag tror på
När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar?

Jag måste börja tro på mig själv

It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good

And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

"[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

"[Verse 1]
Shaking like a dog shitting razorblades
Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me
I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved
While you're taking your time with apologies
I'm making my plans for revenge
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge
I'd drive straight off the edge

[Verse 2]
Taking your own life with boredom
I'm taking my own life with wine
It helps you to rule out the sorrow
It helps me to empty my mind
Making the most of a bad time
I'm smoking the brains from my head
Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red
This kettle is seeing red.

[Chorus]
I've got a big fat fucking bone to pick with you my darling
In case you haven't heard I'm sick and tired of trying
I wish you would take my radio to bathe with you
Plugged in and ready to fall

She says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too

Versus ""No one should ever feel like...""

Eight o'clock, Monday night, and I'm waitin'
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me

[Chorus 1]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Verse 2]
She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have
[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
She likes 'em with a mustache

Drivin' in a Trans-Am
Does a mullet make a man?
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""

There she goes again
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked!
[Chorus 3]
Now I'm watchin' wrestling
Tryna be a tough guy
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (Moped, moped)
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""

Now one look in that direction
And everything starts to hurt

And everytime my boat's about tits up

But it washed up in my sink
And now the city cut my water

If it is then I'm the jerk
Who keeps on hanging around
When I simply should just burn it to the ground
Maybe it's some kind of spell
That I've been living under
Collecting coins found near a nightmare wishing well

Tried to leave it all behind me and almost blew up in my car

There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
And school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it

Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey!)
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)

Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

"[Verse 1]
I watched the proverbial sunrise
Coming up over the Pacific and
You might think I'm losing my mind
But I will shy away from the specifics

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't want you to know where I am
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
And this is no place to try and live my life

[Refrain]
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) Well, I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been
[Verse 2]
I talk to absolutely no one
Couldn't keep to myself enough
And the things bottled inside have finally begun
To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up
And I heard the reverberating footsteps
Syncing up to the beating of my heart
And I was positive that unless
I got myself together I would watch me fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't let that happen again
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

[Refrain]
Stop right there, that's exactly where I lost it
See that line? I never should have crossed it
Stop right there, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) Well, I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back

I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

[Bridge]
Who I am hates who I've been
And who I am will take the second chance You gave me
Who I am hates who I've been
'Cause who I've been only ever made me

So sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change

Be sure I never become that way again

"You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
It's far too bright for you
If they attack you, just lay there
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through

And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream
Recurring, a dream that can't come true
And they'll pin it all on you
After all you've been put through

Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say, and now, miss
Susan A, you're losing every
Opportunity
To put us all away

Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here
You've scared them all to death
If they revive them, just sit there
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath

This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream
That's curdling the blood they found on you
And your knives and clothing too
Charlie's broken .22
Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say, and now, miss
Susan A, you're losing every
Opportunity

Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way
That you've bound and gagged, you've shot and stabbed
You tried to set them free
But they've thrown away the keys
""He represented a God to me that was so beautiful that I'd do anything for him
I'd do anything for God
Even murder, if I believed it was right
How could it not be right if it is done with love?

You have made it harder just to go on

How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here

Holding onto silly things, I never learn

This is happiness
To be everything at once
Be unblinded, be unlearned
Be unbridled and unburned

[Verse 1]
Heavy on our heels
The rocky ground we leave behind
Tassels streaming from our necks
We cast awake amidst the wind
We're the roamers to the road
Barebacked, spirit and in mind

[Refrain]
Oh, to be free like this

[Chorus]
This is happiness
To be everything at once
Be unblinded, be unlearned
Be unbridled and unburned
This is happiness
I'm fearless and I'm free
With the open road and the world beneath my feet

With splinters in our teeth
We're driven from our parallels
Our path a prison, bound to walk
Where countless feet already fell
But there's a wildness in our heart
That we've forgotten in our march

[Refrain]
All to be free like this

This is happiness
To be everything at once
Be unblinded, be unlearned
Be unbridled and unburned
This is happiness
I'm fearless and I'm free
With the open road and the world beneath my feet

We're branded and we're burdened
From the moment we are born
We're domestic and we're discontent
And we're grinding our gums raw
Forget your feet and where they fall
Lift your head and carry on
No fear, just faith
No bend, just break the path
And let it lead you
Unknown, unblind
Run free, run wild
And leave behind what holds you down

Heavy on our heels
The rocky ground we leave behind

This is happiness
To be everything at once
Be unblinded, be unlearned
Be unbridled and unburned

Turn away, if you could get me a drink

'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

Now turn away, 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body

When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Cross your heart and count to three
It's clear to see that what we really need
Is empathy
If there's a will then there's a way
But you've been hiding lately

Don't let reality come in between everything
Trust me, I know, I've been here too before
And if you can't move on I'm leaving you behind

Try, wear me down but in return
I'll give you just what you deserve
Do you think your petty words are gonna make me hurt?
I've been doing fine and that's not your concern
'Cause respect is a virtue
And it's not one you've earned
The world seems to change
But you'll still stay the same
Like an old brush and paint
You're a color to fade
And that's fine if you're happy being
Stuck in your ways
With complacency, my enemy

Take a good look 'cause it's the last that you'll see (Last thing you'll see)

Stay the fuck away from me

I don't want anybody else to feel this way""
No, no, no
[Chorus]
Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well
Since the last time that we spoke, I said
""Please understand I've been drinking again, and all I do is hope""
Please... stay
Please stay

[Verse 3]
I'll admit I was wrong about everything
Cause I'm high and I don't wanna come down
All the fun that we had on your mothers couch
I don't even wanna think about
I'm not strong enough for the both of us
What was I supposed to do
You know I love you
Whoa-oh

"[Verse 1]
It's time to kick the habit, I'm coming clean
It's been a hell of a ride but it's all caught up with me
And now I'm off track
Feel like I'm right back where I started
Sat on the kitchen floor all alone talking to a ghost
About where we go when we go
He said, ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run and…

[Chorus]
Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh my friend, just look how far you've come
And think twice before you go and throw it all away

[Verse 2]
Between the peace and the panic
I can't break up the static
I need a cleaner frequency
I frequently burn out and vanish
I'm on another planet
There's just no getting through to me
But then I find myself in bed
Lost inside my head again
Running over everything
The voices, they are deafening
Out from the noise
I hear that familiar voice
He says ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run, better go
Better jump, run
[Chorus]
Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh my friend, just look how far you've come
And think twice before you go and throw (Throw!) it all away

Just a couple kids on a summer street
Chasing around to a flicker beat
Making mistakes that were made for us
We brushed them off like paper cuts

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay
We said forever but forever wouldn't wait for us

[Chorus]
You were my last young renegade heartache
It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling
We had to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Underneath the lights of a motorway
That's where I go to keep your ghost away
We used to be such a burning flame
Now we're just smoke in the summer rain

You said you're sick and tired of it, it
But I need you morning, night, and day
I miss you every single way-ay-ay

It only took one night
Caught in the eye of a hurricane, darling

I want to know that you're somewhere out there
Somewhere down this road
You were my last young renegade heartache
How could I let you, how could I let you go?

You were the best thing that ever happened to me
And I'll keep on fighting just to make you believe

So heavy that you can't breathe

Stripped away by the pain of broken dreams

Made of other people’s skin
Now that I’m up close I see the cracks
Where you’ve been frankensteinin’

Since I had the realisation -
Vindication that I’m not crazy!

Preaching about mental health

Accidents out on the highway to somewhere
They tell us about when we're young
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes
Before she can see what they've done
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round

Names on her sidewalks, they move through her body
Like razors, they cut through her heart
Like razors, they cut through her heart

And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?

So someone remembers her too

Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you,"" I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin',"" she say, ""What's missin'?"" ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,"" and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, ""Ooh""

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"" and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you,"" she gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga

And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself

And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died
What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?
[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand
From the nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
Born free but still, they hate
Born me, no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong

Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah


[Verse 3]
The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?
We're calling for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah
A brand new song

This life chose me, I’m not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am

But proud I stand of who I am

The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal

They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...

Living for the weekend state of mind Makes me sick
Just thinking of the bad habits
People passing out in parking lots
That you only live once way of thinking
It’s so twisted are you living or just wasted
An escape 'cause you can’t face it

If a psycho said this is the end
I think I’d believe him

Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self-destructs
Pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up

This self-centered generation taking pictures
Of themselves then changing features
Pleasing over critical creatures
Everyones got a cause but how strong is the foundation?
Moving like the waves of the ocean
Do you care or just throw stones in?
If a billboard read this was the end
I think I’d believe it

Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you)

Another night, another dream wasted on you

With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us - not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)

I’ll move on and forget you
We could never see eye to eye
But either way

[Chorus: Ben Barlow with Laura Whiteside]
I like her 'cause she’s smart, headstrong, and independent
She puts me in my place, but I don’t know where I stand
And if only I could find the words, or muster up the nerve to tell her
I’ll never forget her
And she’ll always have a part of me

[Verse 2: Ben Barlow with Laura Whiteside]
Don’t let me go down this road again
We both know where this ends
In a storm of feeling, I’m so unappealing
I can’t play these games

[Chorus 2: Ben Barlow with Laura Whiteside]
I like her 'cause she’s smart, headstrong, and independent
She puts me in my place, but I don’t know where I stand
And if only I could find the words, or muster up the nerve to tell her
I’ll never forget her
And she’ll always have a part of me
I like her 'cause she’s smart, headstrong, and independent
She puts me in my place, but I don’t know where I stand
And if only I could find the words, or muster up the nerve to tell her
I’ll never forget her
And she’ll always have a part of me
She'll always have a part of me
She'll always have a part of me
[Verse 3: Ben Barlow]
I was falling for a girl who would ask me to come over
Just for a day, when her parents were away
Now all I can do is lay in my room
Fall asleep, dream of you
Then wake up and do nothing about it

[Verse 4: Laura Whiteside]
I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way
‘Cause you gotta be safe
So hold back your views
We’re both leaving soon
I can’t fall back on you
‘Cause that’s not what I do and

[Outro: Laura Whiteside & Ben Barlow]
I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way
She hates it when I shout these words but, I still sing for you
'Cause you gotta be safe
I'll still sing for you
I'll still sing for you
So hold back your views, we’re both leaving soon
She hates it when I shout these words but, I still sing for you
I'll still sing for you
I can’t fall back on you, 'cause that's not what I do and
I'll still sing for you

"[Verse 1]
By the time I was your age, I'd give anything
To fall in love truly, was all I could think
That's when I met your mother, the girl of my dreams
The most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen
She said, ""Boy can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I can't help but notice, you're staring at me
I know I shouldn't say this, but I really believe
I can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me.""

[Chorus 1]
Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things

[Verse 2]
Now, most of the time we'd have too much to drink
And we'd laugh at the stars and we'd share everything
Too young to notice and too dumb to care
Love was a story that couldn't compare
I said, ""Girl, can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I made you a present with paper and string
Open with care now, I'm asking you, please
You know that I love you, will you marry me?""

[Chorus 2]
Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things
You'll learn, one day, I'll hope and I'll pray
That God shows you differently
[Verse 3]
She said, ""Boy can I tell you a terrible thing?
It seems that I'm sick and I've only got weeks
Please, don't be sad now, I really believe
You were the greatest thing that ever happened to me.""

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Slow, so slow I fell to the ground on my knees
So don't fall in love, there's just too much to lose
If you're given the choice, then I beg you to choose
To walk away, walk away, don't let her get you
I can't bear to see the same happen to you

Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Nervous and shy

"[Intro]
If you’ve ever been in love
Or ever hope to be in love
Here’s a story you’ll love with all your heart

[Verse 1: Jordan Pundik]
Couples on their backs in the park
Lay on blankets bought
On a date the day before
A routine I’ve been longing for
Can’t help but to glance
From the corner of my resentful eyes
Guess it’s all perspective but
It’s you I never get enough
We’re always far apart

[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]
We’ve got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We’ve got a vicious love

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
When I go out alone
And see them sharing meals
Like Lady and the Tramp
Hate their loving eyes
Wishing it was you and I
Add tip to my receipt
Fold it up behind a picture of us
Guess it’s all perspective but
Together though we rarely touch
Hard not to fall apart
[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]
We’ve got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We’ve got a vicious love

[Bridge: Jordan Pundik]
I could have given up a thousand times
In the past that was so easy
When the thought came to my mind
There was no convincing me
Plant my feet to face it all
Side by side or a phone call
Living in tension with you
Still feels better
Better than I’ve ever known

[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]
We’ve got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We’ve got a vicious love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

You, you think yer such a bad ass
You think yer such a rough neck
Well I saw you outside eating truffles with yer mom on the patio
I think it's really sad though
And tell yer girl ta quit buggin' me
'Cause I saw her outside suckin' dick
In the bathroom of the bus of the Iron Maiden cover band

When your pencil neck breaks, when your bird chest caves in
I'm gonna win
When your pencil neck breaks, when your bird chest caves in

Me, I'm just another gringo
A bitter jalepeno
But I gets more montequilla
In a week than your bitch ass gets in a lifetime
You're steppin' on a land mine

Is goin' on wit yer moms in the clogs and the skirt
Wouldn't fuck'er for my country with a flag on her face and a stolen dick

When you're alone, do you think of me?
And my diamond ring's thrown out to sea
And when you love, do you love for me?
Like harmony, a never ending dream

Oh well, oh well
I still hope for the best
Say goodbye send me off with a kiss farewell
And I promise I'll be just as strong as I can be
Maybe you could get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
So here's your song
It's twisting me
I'd give anything to make you scream
And I'll just smile, and make believe I don't feel a thing
That doesn't work for me

[Chorus]
Oh well, oh well
Guess I'll see you in hell
There's a pretty little picture that's in my head
And I'm starting to dream, changing colors while I sleep
Maybe I'm just wasting time
[Post-Chorus]
Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart
And it's not easy to talk about
So we all scream loud

[Verse 3]
And that was it
I had made it clean just across the street with my new wings
So I'll just fly and hope that I remember the good times when it's done

[Chorus]
Oh well, oh well
I can't live with myself
As I'm climbing in your window to get to your bed
And I'll be what you need
You can call me anything
Just as long as we're still friends

[Post-Chorus]
Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart, and it's not easy to talk about
So we all sing

[Bridge]
When she smiles well it's got nothing to do with me
I'm not the one who sings her to sleep
And I've been talking to God asking for just a little help with you but it's hopeless
It's not the first time but this one really carved it in
And tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again
Oh, Oh it's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that no one knows you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again

I’ve given up on giving up slowly
I’m blending in so you won’t even know me
Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention
Is my one last shot at redemption

I promise I’m going because

Ooh, I gotta get outta here

Ooh, I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging You, I'm begging You
I’m begging You to be my escape

I'm given up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I’m ready to be shown how
You've told me the way and now I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

Self-detained and forced to live in this mess I've made

At least a thousand times or more

Where we all used to say
""I know anywhere's better than here""

Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with

"[Verse 1]
I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in Period One
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen

[Chorus]
But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

[Verse 2]
I used to work in a record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A
That seems to be where
Everybody else ends up these days

But I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you

Are you alone now?
Did you lose the monkey?
He gave you backaches
And now you slouch
He didn't mean it
Was just a dumb ape
Reading Playboy
On your couch

Baby, baby, baby
C'mon, what's wrong?
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you wanna get some sun?
Shine on, shine on, shine on

I went to Pittsburgh
And joined a pro team
Talk about a bad dream
I broke a knee
But I can still croon
And make the girls swoon
Isn't that the way life's
Supposed to be?

"It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I needed strength to change my mind, but these ghosts stick to me like glue
Hating life, believing I was no good

It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone

It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I built this cloud to live in, it was a bunch of lies in my mind
The world wants me to believe it, so I had to change my mind

It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone

I built this cloud, I can break it
The world can't change how I feel
Because I know it's a lie

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'

Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit

And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers

And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower

Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there and I'm here waiting
And I wrote this letter in my head
'Cause so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone and I can't think straight

[Pre-Chorus]
This could be the one last chance to make you understand, yeah

I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you

Together we broke all the rules
Dreaming of dropping out of school
And leave this place but never come back
So now, maybe after all these years
If you miss me, have no fear
I'll be here, I'll be waiting

This could be the one last chance to make you understand
And I just can't let you leave me once again, yeah

"I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days and glory never fades
Never fades, fades away

After years and miles, my broken feet
Walk back to you up this broken street
I guess the years went by, but the years just made you shine
And never fade, fade away

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold

I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades

Years passed by and you remind me
Those things will always find me
Young hearts are made of gold that never fades away
Never fades, fades away

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
As the years pass by
A young heart beats inside
These dreams of yours and mine that time can't take away
Take away, take away

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold

I'm sick of waiting
Sick of all these words that will never matter

Hoping for a chance to think on time
And I'm tracing over your letter
To see if your intentions are as good as mine

You're getting worse and I know

Don't worry your pictures are already burned

No, I can’t stand the pain

Got nowhere to run

Everybody’s screaming
I try to make a sound, but no one hears me
I’m slipping off the edge, I’m hanging by a thread

So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
And I can’t explain what happened
And I can’t erase the things that I've done

And war is boring, it's not enough, I need a shock down to my shoes

So I don't have to live with me
Slavery is still alive

Take anything you want
Just don't show me who I am

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free
Kill me with everything until there's nothing left of me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free

Give me some gasoline
Give me some gasoline
The beginning of this new time is coming to an end
We have run from all our ills, but we won't run again
Toxic meat, political deceit, medicate me 'til I'm dead
And I'll take life from your can, just don't show me who I am

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free

No one ever died for my sins in Hell
As far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be

[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
At the center of the Earth, in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says ""home is where your heart is,"" but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care
[Verse 4: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere

[Verse 8: Billie Joe Armstrong]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

[Verse 9: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists

And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I've walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time!

"Last call now I'm outta time
And I don't got no valentine
Singled out, now I stand alone
The underdog in a modern world
Suburbia is hot tonight
But nothing seems to feel alright
I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me

Hey ho let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it
One two fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you
Can't you see it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

Fit the mold and do what you're told
Get a job and start growing old
9 to 5 can make your dreams come true
But I don't wanna be like you
I'm not cool and I'll never be
I break the rules and I guarantee
I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me
Hey ho let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it
One two fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you
Can't you see it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

You call me a loser
Say I'm just a user
But I'll just keep on moving
Cause that's the art of losing

Hey ho let's go
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it
One two, fuck you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't wanna be like you
Can't you see, it's killing me
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down I'll keep on moving

[Verse 1]
This spring is gonna be the best one since 1981
Or so they've all been sayin' that
Might just buy me one of them Maine Coon cats
And serenade him basking in the sun on my front porch

[Chorus]
I'm not sleeping tonight
Sit back and watch the sunset work its magic
In its own true light
I'm not sleeping tonight
So come on over

[Verse 2]
You'll make a butter lettuce salad
With all natural ingredients, except for cottage cheese
Its from the factories at our grocery store
We'll stock our coolers with them
That we'll pick up sometimes when we run low

[Chorus]
I'm not sleeping tonight
Sit back and watch the sunset work its magic
In its own true light
I'm not sleeping tonight
So come on over
[Bridge]
Maybe I'll just slip into the moonlight
And catch a trail of stardust in your eyes
Ohh
Maybe I'll just fall ever more in love with you
Maybe I'll just fall

I'm not sleeping tonight
Sit back and watch the sunset work its magic
In its own true light
I'm not sleeping tonight

Days swiftly come and go
I'm dreaming of her
She's seeing other guys
Emotions astir
The sun is gone
The nights are long
And I am left while the tears fall

Did you think that I would cry
On the phone?
Do you know what it feels like
Being alone?
I'll find someone new

My heart is crushed by a former love
Can you help me find a way to carry on again?

She knows I was wrong
The notes are old
They bend, they fold
And so do I to a new love

"[Verse 1]
Pry the darkness from my eyes
Divided, let the light seep in
Trees devoid of branches and hollow hives
Endless black and empty beds
It's not the same, something's changed
I never used to be able to see past the trees
A thousand unfamiliars are lying thick on the air
And I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
I'll tear apart the town then sleep, then sleep alone

[Verse 2]
If I'm a flame, I'm a forest fire
Speaking savage tongues as I emerge from the hills
I am an avalanche
I am unchained, I'm awoken, I'll unleash hell
So I roar, pin back my ears and stone by stone
I'll tear it all, I'll tear it apart

[Chorus]
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
I'll tear apart the town then sleep, then sleep alone
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
[Bridge]
I've lost faith, the forest's changed
My stomach's empty, I'm feeling faint
I've lost heart, the forest's scarred
I hear no birds, just TVs, and cars
I've lost faith, the forest's changed
My stomach's empty, I'm feeling faint
I've lost sight, the forest's died
The brambles are bare, and I'm hollow inside
Each breath rattles like dice in my chest
Each breath gambled, unwinding 'til death

[Chorus]
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?

"[Verse 1]
Storming through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""

[Chorus]
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Verse 2]
Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then
It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn
[Chorus]
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

[Bridge]
Don't count on me to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing
Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening

[Breakdown]
Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion

[Chorus]
I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh

And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick

Man, I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold
She's walkin' over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe

She'll wash her hair
His dirty clothes are all he gives to her
And he's got posters on the wall
Of all the girls he wished she was
And he means everything to her

[Chorus]
Her boyfriend, he don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned, Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the weak

It's Friday night and she's all alone
He's a million miles away
She's dressed to kill, but the TV's on
He's connected to the sound
And he's got pictures on the wall
Of all the girls he's loved before
And she knows all his favorite songs

Let's admire the pattern forming
Murderous filigree
I'm caught in the twisting of the vine
Go ascend with ivy climbing
Ignore and leave for me
The headstone crumbling behind

I can't help my laughter as she cries
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes

[Verse 2]
Let's amend the classic story
Close it so beautifully
I'll let animosity unwind
Steal away the darkened pages
Hidden so shamefully
I'll still feel the violence of the lies

I can't stand my laughter as they cry
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes
And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolence

I'm always screaming my lungs out, 'til my head starts spinning
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life
Won't keep my voice down
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud
I like to keep things honest
I'm a safe bet, like your life's staked on it, for real
I'd hate to keep you all wondering
I'm constant, like the seasons, and I will never be forgotten, man

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa, you know to keep your
Hopes up high and your head down low

Keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Still got something left to prove, it tends to keep things movin'
While everyone around me says my last days are looming
Overhead, but what the hell do they think they know?
My head's above the water, while they drown in the undertow

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

Hopes up high and your head down low

If you take it from me
Live your life for yourself
'Cause when it's all said and done
You don't need anyone else, c'mon!

[Verse 3]
So, let's get back to when everything seemed perfect
Not a worry in the world, tell me, was this all worth it?
I get what I want, so, everyone's always judging me
I'm not afraid of anything, I've got the whole world in front of me

All I want is a place to call my own
To mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone

"I'm standing at your grave
And you've forgotten me
For not forgiving you
I wonder if it's right
To feel the way I do
Cause I feel so empty
I wonder what went wrong
When all I did was right
When all I did was right
I wonder where you are
Nothing seems so far
But it feels so empty
And you let it slip away
We're getting older now you say
We're getting older now
We're getting older now
Driving by your house
The windows all blacked out
The lights are all down low

I wonder where you are
Nothing seems so far
But it seems so empty
Then you let it slip away
We're getting older now you say
We're getting older now

Standing at your grave
There's no one left to save
But I feel so empty

One look puts the rhythm in my hand

Cover up with makeup in the mirror

You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world'll bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown

Like your favorite Heatmiser song goes
""It's just like being alone.""

[Chorus 2]
Oh god, please don't tell me this has been in vain
I need answers for what all the waiting I've done means
You kill me, you've got some nerve but can't face your mistakes
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't turn away
[Bridge]
So go on, love
Leave while there's still hope for escape
Gotta take what you can these days
There's so much ahead and so much regret
I know what you want to say
I know it but can't help feeling differently
I loved you and I should have said it
But tell me just what has it ever meant?

[Chorus 3]
I can't help it baby, this is who I am
Sorry, sorry, but I can't just go turn off how I feel
You kill me, you build me up but just to watch me break
Hey hey, hey hey
I know what I should do but I just can't walk awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night
We drove out to see Las Vegas
We lost ourselves in the bright lights
I wish you could have seen us
Begging for change to get home
Or at least San Francisco
Let's put a ten on the high card
And spend a summer on the West Coast

[Pre-Chorus]
Down and to the left
Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at
Be California's best
All I ask, all I ask

[Chorus]
Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming
When all I ever wanted was to
Dream another sunset with you
If I roll over when it's over
I'll take this Cali sunrise with me
And wake up with the fondest memories

[Verse 2]
We made love by the ocean
As the waves crashed around you
Sunsets never were so bright
And the skies, never so blue
You opened up into my arms
And we laughed as I held you
I'll never go back to Georgia
Not at least 'til I have to
[Pre-Chorus]
Down and to the left
Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at
Be California's best

Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay
And maybe when you get back
I'll be off to find another way

You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know
So take your gloves and get out
Better get out while you can

""I don't love you like I did yesterday""?

So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out

Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up

"[Verse 1]
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You'd never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December
[Verse 2]
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could've been
My mistakes were not intentions
This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should've said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should've said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned

I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors

"[Verse 1]
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality but I can't
Let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
Yeah, what? Come on. What? Yeah, what?
Here we go

[Verse 2]
Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you kids later...)
We checked his room, his things were gone, we didn't see him no more, dick!

[Pre-Chorus]
Things, things, here we go!

[Chorus]
The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today, go!
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now

What! What! What! Here we go...
Little things, little things, little things, little things
Little things, little things, little things, little things
Little things, little things, little things, little things
Little things, little things, little things, here we go!
And it always seems those little things they take the biggest part of me break down, I'm breaking down...

"[Verse 1]
Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold (Speak to me)

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold

Move along, move along like I know ya do

""Almost forty-eight hours have passed since the fall of an atomic bomb, and an attack upon the cities of man. And even now we are only beginning to see the aftermath of a massive display of destruction and power, that has uprooted our fresh outset of peace in civilized society. Despite the rubble, there is a predominant sense of wonder and marvel at the awesome nature of this technological terminus that has bewildered the very core of the human psyche.""

Sometimes, at night I let it get to me
And sometimes, I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night it had me down, I'm feeling numb
I can try, but sometimes that is not enough

[Pre-Chorus]
No, sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up, or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

[Verse 2]
And thinking back upon those days
Way, way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
'Cause I was always on the run
Well you know just what they say
""Just like father then like son""
Don't delude me with your sympathy
'Cause I can do this on my own
[Pre-Chorus]
And this won't be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
'Cause the truth is
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head so

Stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna

"När sommarn' har börjat
Och ligger framför oss
Då undrar man vad man ska göra
Man grunnar och tänker på tusen ideér
Och lyssna nu ska ni få höra:

Man kan ju

Bygga raketer
Fightas med mumier
Stå i Eiffeltornet och rapa
Upptäcka något
Som aldrig funnits
Tvätta och bada en apa
Surfa på en våg
Lattja och ha kul
Leta i huven och stå
Hitta fåglar små
Måla jorden gul
Syrran får mer än hon tål!

Sommarn är lång
Det finns massor med kul om
Man bara tar det kallt
Så häng med oss för Phineas och Ferb
Dom kommer att göra allt

Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna176EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

""Go to college or university
Get a real job!"" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?

I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now, cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same

I learned some things about the places I saw
I learned some things about myself
I guess it came the hard way
Now I know what counts
I've got one prayer, it's in your confidence
I know all the places I don't want to be
Everyone's gone, there's no one, just me
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same

Remember me next time I go away
For the first time in my life I wanna stay
I could count one hand here today
The only things that matter to me anyway
And it seems so far away
It seems so far away

Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone
I've done some time
Sleeping where I fall
I know I'll never be the same
Remember me now cause things always change
Five long years are gone

She's the girl that no one ever knows
And I say hi, but she's too shy to say hello
She's just waiting for that one to take her hand
And shake her up, I bet I could

It's a barren land, but they all throw shade
I can't make peace, post-modern age

And there's nothing new under the sun
You see, I like it so much better when I'm safe inside
And at times your good company is hard to find
To keep a nourished mind, I need water

While everyone is living it up
But it's way too hot to go outside
When I don't relate to anyone

When I don't relate to anyone
Call me anti-social

And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga, you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches

What's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, one-eighty-seven
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass, TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes

Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy

Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt

Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon' get so smoked out
And then I went, got locked up, every night, I dreamt I broke out

"Once there was a time when we could learn
All the simple pleasantries a follower should yearn
Now all that I can do is watch them burn
And wish that I could save them all, or just one

See the fake, everyday shaking hands of men, promising the end
Hear Him Speak of all the things that we need to hear, to adhere

Justify, your secrecies that surmise your cries
I see the way you look around the bend
Is it going to end, when?

The visions that I've seen have left me torn
Between the resurrection and the prophecy unborn
I think that I will document the fall
And say I hate to say it, but I told you all

See the fake, everyday shaking hands of men, promising the end

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
I feel the fire burning out
It's not worth saving
You've held me back, tied me down
Now I'm suffocating
I handed you a loaded gun
Dare you to take a shot
And after all that's said and done
Should’ve picked a fight you could’ve won

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't take much to get you on your knees
But you're never gonna get the best of me
I know what I want and it's everything you're not

[Chorus]
I know they call me crazy, cause I'm not changing
It's people like you, driving me insane
You're not sorry, that I'm not sorry
Sorry that you lost me
Now we're just strangers
(Now we're just strangers)

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, I'm stepping out
A risk worth taking
You never mind, can't hold me down
Are you sick of faking?
They handed you a loaded gun
One chance to take a shot
But now we're done
[Chorus]
I know they call me crazy, cause I'm not changing
It's people like you, driving me insane
You're not sorry, that I'm not sorry
Sorry that you lost me
Now we're just strangers
(Now we're just strangers)

[Bridge]
It's too late for apologies
But you won't get my sympathy
(You won't get the best of me)
Woah, Woah, Woah

[Chorus]
I know, they call me crazy cause I'm not changing
It's people like you, driving me insane
You're not sorry, that I'm not sorry
Sorry that you lost me
Now we're just

"[Verse 1]
Don't waste your touch, you won't feel anything
Or were you sent to save me?
I've thought too much, you won't find anything
Worthy of redeeming

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo he estado aquí muchas veces antes y regresó

[Chorus]
To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

[Verse 2]
Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy
So what befalls the flawless?
Look what I've built (please don't do this)
It shines so beautifully (why won't you look at me)
Now watch as it destroys me

[Pre-Chorus]
Y regreso aquí otra vez y comienzo

To break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

[Bridge]
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all behind, and never said goodbye
I left it all to die

I saw its birth, I watched it grow
I felt it change me
I took the life, I ate it slow
Now it consumes me

[Chorus]
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away
Break down, and cease all feeling
Burn now, what once was breathing
Reach out, and you may take my heart away

Oh, down the drain, wash it away
Just like storm water
Let it strip you of the things

And I swear you'll see it bloom

Hold your virtues now
Searching for blue butterflies

Treading undersize

And don't you drown, I'm counting on
Seeing you get wiser
And when the tide's too hard to bear
This is a reminder
You can't stare at the sun
And hope it never fades, it still gets dark
Gets dark

But there's still light from the moon

[Verse 1]
I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creeping about, these people are
Freaking me out these days

[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone, there's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me? And why can't anyone see

[Chorus]
I just wanna live?
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

[Post-Chorus]
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

[Verse 2]
I rock a lawsuit when I'm going to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Talking on the phone, got an interview
With the Rolling Stone, they're saying
""Now you're rich and now you're famous
Fake-ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Your first hit, aren't you ashamed?""
Of the life, of the life
Of the life we're living

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live

""Stop your messing around, boy!
Better think of your future!
Better make some good plans, boy!""
Said everyone of my teachers
Look out! You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say where we're coming from
We've already seen the worst that this life can bring
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say, yeah, we already know

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me

Maybe it's best you leave me alone

It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes

Eyes are feeling heavy but they never seem to close
The fan blades on the ceiling spin but the air is never cold
And even though you are next to me I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything for you to call your own

[Chorus 1]
And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight

[Verse 2]
Something I've been keeping locked away behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free with each and every kiss
I couldn't bear to hurt you but it's all so different now
Things that I was sure of, they have filled me up with doubt

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?

I can feel you breathing

Could you stop my heart? It's always beating
Sinking like a weight

How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done?
I don't know if i should stay or turn around and run
I know that I hurt you, things will never be the same

I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

It’s there everyday waiting to strangle us all
You might not see it coming, in fact you usually won’t
And you hope that it’ll unwrap its hands from your throat

Sometimes the days just drift away
Sometimes it’s hard to see the way
Through all the noise, through all the waste...
And that’s the way we burn

Cause it’s like a killing desire
So messed up
You’d trade your whole life
For a fucking minute on fire

There’s a black cat staring back at me
Every time I look outside
I don’t know his agenda but I tend
To be reminded of mistakes I’ve made
They play on a loopIn my mind
But what business does an animal without a soul
Have to concern itself with mine?
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the days just drift away
Sometimes it’s hard to see the way
And I know I could save today or
Go insane today, I guess I’ll never learn
And when I try a voice inside’s
Always screaming “Fuck it, watch me burn!”

And it's all that I can think about when you tell me that you cheated
Eighty on the porch drinking lemonade with you
And it's all that I can think about when you tell me that you cheated on me
I knew that you would, I knew 'cause ya told me it runs in your family

It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

[Verse 2]
There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

While there's still something left to save!"" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)

For the questions that you still have!""

And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

No more of anything, anything, anything but the rain
It melts my smile straight down the drain

Afraid of everything, everything, everything and the shame
It wipes that smile right off your face

[Verse 1]
When the lights go off, I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger, go on and play the leader
'Cause you know it's what you're good at, the low road for the fast track
Make every second last

[Chorus]
'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd

[Verse 2]
Live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home-team
I'll be the narrator, telling another tale of the American dream
I see your name in lights, we can make you a star
Girl, we'll take the world by storm, it isn't that hard

[Chorus]
'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd, woah-oh-oh!
[Post-Chorus]
Haha!

[Bridge]
Take a breath, don't it sound so easy? Never had a doubt, now I'm going crazy
Watching from the floor
Take a breath, and let the rest come easy, never settle down, 'cause the cash flow leaves me
Always wanting more

[Chorus]
'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd

"[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do
[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

[Chorus]
'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
Constellations
Rising and falling
Complications
Blame it on myths and stories
And I've been kinda hoping
That it was just a mistake
You're feeling out of your place
Time after time it's what I get for
Believing in higher places
Downfall
Ignorance wasn't important
Maybe I could've seen it
But I guess I never learn
I keep on hoping harder
I'll set myself up for closure

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel like nothing left?
Do you grow a sense of regret?
'Cause I don't wanna know but I wanna know
Was this our fate after all?

[Chorus]
I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, you left, left
I've seen every stage of grief I can over again
Are you feeling whole again?
Is this separation how it ends?
'Cause I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, I'll live
[Verse 2]
Never ending
Don't wanna leave when I'm still healing
Give me back my energy, I'm
Too weak to clean up this mess
Unwoven bound to undress
It's all too hard to predict
I can't choose the words on your lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel like nothing left?
Do you grow a sense of regret?
'Cause I don't wanna know but I wanna know
Was this our fate after all?

[Bridge]
Do you feel like nothing left?
Do you grow a sense of regret?
'Cause I don't wanna know, but I wanna know
Was this our fate after all?
Been pushing and pulling, but I can't consume it
Our souls in disguises let this end
[Chorus]
I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, you left, left
I've seen every stage of grief I can over again
Are you feeling whole again?

"Give me your misery, all of it give it to me
I can hold onto it for you, it’s not a problem
I just want your energy, a piece of that fractured mountain
I’ll take whatever comes with it as long as it’s yours

And all I know is that I want it more than yesterday
If I was waiting, I was waiting for just one little spark
You are the brightest I’ve seen, you are the best side of me
And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart

But I want the whole damn thing

I feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too
Seeing forever this downcast bleed from the sky
Could never sever through, not what we have me and you
Burning together and burning forever

And I don’t know, I just can feel it in the atmosphere
If I’m wandering, I’ve wandered into just the right spot
You are the fire in my sleep, you are the reason I dream
And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart

I’ve got a piece of your heart, but I want the whole damn thing

Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore
The years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die
But we’ll get by
And it goes on forever just like this
If I could go back, I would do it all over with you again

I’ve got a piece of your heart, but I want the whole damn thing

Say hello to all my problems for me
Tell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore

Because mi sit down inna di tour, but I freeze
Thinking about the sunshine under trees
Summertime on the beach
So fine, oh you know say that I'm in dem trees
Baby girl, you really got what mi need
It's three o'clock, and we deh deh anytime that you need
In a heartbeat, girl, sex on the beach

Loving increase, put it upon repeat

Someday
I will find my way back
To where your name
Is written in the sand
(Bring it back, bring it back, rewind, rewind)

'Cause I remember every sunset (Well, I remember)
I remember every word you said
We were never gonna say goodbye (No way)

Tell me how to get back to
Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

I remember where we first kissed (I remember)
And how I didn't wanna leave your lips
And how I've never ever felt so high (So high)

Back to summer paradise with you (Yeah)
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

"[Verse 1]
I’m a mess, that's the best way to describe it
Having no time to myself is the only way I can fight it
When I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror
Don't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer
I miss your family and I miss all our friends
If you had it to do over, would you do it over again?
'Cause I would, it means something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

[Chorus]
You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired, so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

[Verse 2]
I confess that I brought this all on myself
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me’s missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
And I’ve never had the upper hand
[Pre-Chorus]
I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried

[Chorus]
You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired, so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life

[Bridge]
All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place? Oh!

[Breakdown]
I play it cool, but it's hard to be (All my trust!)
Is slowly burning inside of me (Over what?)
There can't be anymore progress, I know our fate
The only thing that can heal this is time and space

[Chorus]
You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired, so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I’ll live with regret for my whole life
For my whole life!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

[Post-Chorus]
Get ready, 'cause this is war

[Verse 1]
There are days that I think I’m crazy
Other days, nothing seems to faze me
There’s nothing more, and nothing less, just
All the fears that I must confess, well
I’m afraid I believe in nothing
No hopes or dreams, you could’ve left me dead
Naive and not to mention
I’m losing count of all my blessings (with all I've done...)

[Pre-Chorus]
With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become

So, all that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way

Get ready, 'cause this is war

Another day in the right direction
I’m okay, but I’m left to question
How did I get so far behind the rest?
Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays, you don’t even faze me
It’s all the same, and I don’t stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension (with all I've done...)

I must be honest
Under the surface
It grinds like a blender
The sound of two voices
My heart seems to fail me
It put me in a stranger's bed
It hurt who I love the most

That's why I don't want what I want
'Cause what I want, it just might kill me
And I won't think of my needs
'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me

Envy is endless
I used to put mistakes up on a board
Compare how mine sticks
Next to the rest of the worlds'
That got me nowhere but miles from changing

Call me on everything 'cause I can't help myself

Posting slogans on a photo of the sky
You're letting sleeping dogs lie

Do what makes you happy

And you don’t have the right friends

And so I buried it
I buried it
Got by
Killed what I thought would die
Don't got no alibi
I buried it
I fucking buried it

[Verse 2]
And now all of my tales
Have damned me to this jail
I hit the final nail
I buried it (I buried it)
But still dead things creep
And stalk me in my sleep
Think I'm about to freak
I buried it
I fucking buried it

[Chorus]
Run away
Run for your life
Before the monster gets inside
(I can't believe my eyes)
Thought it was dead
And gone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it had been so long
I never thought I'd live to see the dead walk
[Post-Chorus]
See the dead walk
See the dead walk
See the dead walk

[Verse 3]
The skeletons that wrote
This twisted horror show
They’re coming from below to bury me (To bury me)
So hush, don't make a sound
There's terrors all around
They crawled out of the ground to bury me
To fucking bury me

[Chorus]
Run away
Run for your life
Before the monster gets inside
(I can't believe my eyes)
Thought it was dead
And gone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it had been so long
I never thought I'd live to see the dead walk

[Bridge]
Doctor
Do you know what's been eating me alive
Like a necrotizing parasite?
Like a lie
It burns and crawls beneath your skin
They say that in turn you turn in to
What you've always been
[Chorus]
Run away
Run for your life
Before the monster gets inside
(I can't believe my eyes)
Thought it was dead
And gone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it had been so long
I never thought I'd live to see the dead walk
Run away
Run for your life
Before the monster gets inside
(I can't believe my eyes)
Thought it was dead
And gone
But I was so wrong
'Cause it had been so long
And life went on
Thought it was done
I was so wrong
The secret's out
I never thought I'd live to see the dead walkEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?
The bombs are getting closer everyday
""That can never happen here"" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

[Verse 2]
To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream
So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

[Bridge]
Well trodden paths are all we take
We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light
[Chorus]
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream...11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Well I can't regret
Can't you just forget it?
I started something I couldn't finish
And if we go down, we go down together

Well best friends means
And I've got a twenty-dollar bill
That says you're up late night starting
Fist fights vs. fences in your backyard
Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor
Soakin' in sympathy
From friends who never loved you
Nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

The jealousy that became got me thinking

That you always had it way too easy

Another Friday night, to get the feeling right
At the bar when he sees her comin' over
What you gonna do, if she walks up to you?
Tongue tied, better get yourself together
Pound another drink, to give him time to think
What's your sign? Hey, I think you know a friend of mine

All the stupid lines, that he had ever heard
Wouldn't come to mind, he couldn't say a word

Tonight, tonight, he's gonna get it right
Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

Got her holding steady, forgot her name already
Sweatin' hard, not a smooth operator
She's got it goin' on, dancing to her favorite song
He's got the line, is it your place or mine?

She turns and walks away, where did he go wrong?
But waiting by the car, she says what took you so long

Even losers can get lucky sometimes
All the freaks go on a winning streak
In a perfect world, all the geeks get the girls

The very next day, he guessed she ran away
The one and only in his bed so lonely
But she comes walkin' in, with coffee and a grin
Crazy as it seems, it wasn't just a dream

And all around the world, people shouted out
The geeks got the girl

"[Verse 1]
I dragged this lake looking for corpses
Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards
Pieces of planes and black box recorders
Don't lie
And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sixth senses
That sense DNA on barbed wire fences
Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect
That has no alibi

[Chorus]
But at the right place at the right time
I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine
And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit
For anyone but me
And at the right place at the right time
It will have been worth it to stand in line
And you won't have to stop
Saying ""I love cops"" for anyone but me
Your private eye

New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven
I watched flies fuck on channel 11
There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink
Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink
And there's no ring on the phone anymore
There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor
Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry

When it’ll run out
Sooner or later
I’ll be hit by a bus any day now
Are your eyes blocked by cataracts
You can't see how good you have it
You’re taking a smile for granted

You’re gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back

Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren’t saying anything

I haven't been home for a while, I'm sure everything's the same
Mom and dad both in denial, an only child to take the blame
Sorry mom, but I don't miss you, father's no name you deserve
I'm just a kid with no ambitions, wouldn't come home for the world
You'll never know what I've become, the king of all that's said and
Done, the forgotten son
This city's buried in defeat, I walk along these no name streets
Wave goodbye to all as I fall...

Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground

All innocence is long gone

That the worst one in your life will land right on

"[Verse 1]
I could have just held my tongue
I should have just filled my lungs

You should have known better than telling me I should have

I’m barely together myself

I’m overthinking, everything I say and I do
Just reminds me I don’t need you
'Cause there’s nothing left for me to hang on to

Well, if you'd just kept your word
And listened instead of just heard
Instead of just waiting for your turn to speak
Then you’d know I was weak, but you don’t
No wonder reality hurts

I’m overthinking, everything I say and I do
Just reminds me I don’t need you

""What are you talking about? America is not going to be destroyed.""

""Never?
Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed
All great countries are destroyed, why not yours?
How much longer do you think your own country will last?
Forever?""

[Verse 1]

Block the entrances, close the doors
Seal the exits because this is war
All gave some, some gave all
But for what? I want to know

[Hook]

Carry on, don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight, bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
[Verse 2]

A folded flag, a purple heart
A family all but torn a part
I fought with courage to preserve
Not my way of life, but yours

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

The cowards preach from pedestals
With words like ""courage"" and ""resolve""
But what they meant was ""Fuck them all""
Because freedom isn't free
They send our daughters and our sons
To deserts under burning suns
A sacrificial slaughtering
To fill the pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy, are we so easily deceived?

They carry on

[Outro]
""You're a shameful opportunist! What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.""

""You have it backwards. It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.""
Don't carry on, just walk away
How many more sent to their graves?
In this lesson ignored
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life

When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me

I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are

Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero

Let's start it here
Back in nineteen-seventy-sumthin'
I can't pin down the year
When the romance wasn't dead
And love still stood for something
There was a girl who'd lost her way
She blushed red when he came over
And they danced the night away
And he sung as he drove her home and
It was there that she would say
""If I could, then I would save you""
And he smiled and turned away
In six weeks they're saying ""I do""
Oh, love just don't go that way no more

[Chorus]
And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all
[Verse 2]
And now it's nineteen-ninety-sumthin'
How the hell did we end up here?
Four kids and a few jobs later
And the pictures fill the pages
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But you'd be a fool to give it up
'Cause you know that what we've got is bigger than the two of us
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But it's bigger than the two of us
And I will hold you in my arms
When you feel like giving up
Love just don't go that way no more

And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family

And face the rain like you wouldn't believe

If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all

And now its two-thousand-and-sumthin'
We made it here my dear
Grandkids and the mortgage paid off
Is this what dreams are made of?
'Cause baby we made it
Yeah baby, you saved me
But nothing could save him
From the ambulance that day
When he went away
The heart attack was sharp
He didn't feel no pain
If you saw him now then what
What would you say?
I love you and I miss you
I owe you everything
And I hope you know you saved me (Saved me!)
[Verse 4]
Oh mother
Mother please don't cry
'Cause you know I miss him too
I didn't even say goodbye
And though he's gone, I know he's gone
He lives on in all of us
And I will hold you when you cry
'Cause that's what he would've done (Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done (Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done

These vultures won’t stop til I’m
Only bones
Only bones
Only

[Bridge]
I’ve been missing the parts of me that used to be
Before you came and
Ripped everything away
Ripped everything away
And if I had a spine left I’d tell you to
Regurgitate the time you ate you selfish fucking cannibal
[Chorus]
Bleed me dry with your vampire teeth (don’t worry)
Don’t worry, it’s fine
I don’t need that blood anyway (just take it away)
Tear my flesh, you can take the rest (don’t worry)
Don’t worry now
These vultures won’t stop til I’m
Only bones

"[Verse 1: Jake Bundrick]
Katy, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest, and the hardest part is letting
Go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling, and you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best

[Verse 2: Derek Sanders]
You're all that I hoped I'd find in every single way
And everything I would give is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something, I just haven't found it yet
But I need it, so
[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes

For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best

[Verse 3: Jake Bundrick]
And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly, so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes

We don't belong here

[Verse 1]
In a way, we are all connected
Threaded together
In a way, we are all suspended
Bound going nowhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Wake up
Walk on the wires
Defeat and define
Wake up
Evolve and escape
Unravel, unmake yourself

[Chorus]
We speak in tongues
And we walk on the wires between
(We don't belong here)
We are the sleeping sickness
The dancing dreams
(We don't belong here)
We're invaders from the inside
We're survivors in silver skin
Shapeless, we move
Unwinding the wires between
(We don't belong here)
[Verse 2]
So we'll follow, follow down
Each knotless fathom to the end
No more hollow, hollow sounds
Of echoes, echoes in our heads

[Pre-Chorus]
Wake up
Walk on the wires
Connect and combine
Wake up
React and reshape
Untangle, unmake yourself

Shapeless, we move
Unwinding the wires between

It's been a long, long night
And we're still learning how to survive
Will you walk with me a while
And see a world with brand new eyes?
We see the sights
And we're fighting for our lives
Will you run?
Will you run?
Will you run?

(It's no longer survival of the fittest)
(Now that everyone survives)
(But we don't want to survive)

"[Verse 1]
I've been stuck in the middle pages
Hung up on a cross that I created
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

[Pre-Chorus]
If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

[Verse 2]
The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (fuck)
Falling in and out of bed sleep so hard
Feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons
(You're not beneath this)
[Pre-Chorus]
If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine

And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

So pick yourself up
You can't change what's been
You must go on
And learn while you live
And when you see the signs saying hope is up ahead
Then you're right on track for a better end

'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb

Get you!

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry)

"[Verse 1]
Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

[Chorus]
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Verse 2]
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend

Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life

Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
That girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up; she's trippin' on the phone now
He had to get out and he ain't comin' home now
He's trying to forget her; that's how he got with her
When he first met her, when they first got together
[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""

To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
[Verse 3]
We break up, it's something that we do now
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay, let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be trippin' on the phone here
Get off the wire you know everything is good here
Stop what you're doing, you don't wanna ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one
[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live

"I don't know what other people say

I guess I'd be screwed

I always come back to you

I can't do the things you want me to
I'm kinda lazy

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease

Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""whine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

So don't debate, a player straight

Gotta play the field, and keep it real

From the tongue, it slips some simple twist of fate
To shape and shake the room we were standing in

In the tonic of you once again
Where ignorance was bliss

Do you remember?

"Twenty one, feeling down
I tell you nothing with a thousand words and I
Weaker get with every step
I waste my time on compact disc's and stale fish
I can't remember the last time I did something
That made me feel all right for longer than a few hours
If I only had the strength to make some muffins
Then I swear that I would share them with you now

Am I odd or am I not?
That's the question I spend time analyzing
I'm so soft but still I'm not
Living up to what people want me to be
Cause I'm busy with me, myself and I can't
Be understood by someone I don't know to well
So I'm shutting out the whole world just to play Nintendo
I've got these new games but I'm afraid you can't join me

These last few years I've been struggling
And I'm tired of keeping a low profile
So now it's time to show that I'm alive
I'm gonna change my life
Change my plans
Change my Vans
Even start to dance now
Change my thoughts
Change my sox
Change my moves
Even change my pro fighter Q for you
No its not for you
And change mine just for me
Change mine just for me

"[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

"[Verse 1]
Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine, until you came around
And I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

[Verse 2]
You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me
[Bridge]
Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

[Chorus]
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I'm going crazy
'Cause there are things in the streets I don't believe
So, we'll pretend it's alright (Pretend it's alright)

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off

Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you

Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me

The whispers turn into a scream
And I...

Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast

Rescuing a tiger from a tree

So I come over and over and over

"I was alone, I decided to get up, decided to get out
I picked up the phone and I gave my boys a shout
Told them I'd be out around nine, no particular plan
Just whatever comes to mind

Bryan called me up, said there's a show tonight
Do you want to go tonight, I'm giving my girl the night off
'Cause I'm hanging out with Steinkopf
Whenever I'm down, I know where my friends can be found
Whenever there's a doubt, I just have to shout

He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time

Another night and we got somewhere to go
Going out, meeting up at the punk rock show
Where the air is hot and the music is loud
My kind of place, this is my kind of crowd

And we'll be here 'til the night is through
Loyal to my friends and sworn to fun

He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime

A crooked spine, my senses dulled
Past the point of delirium

[Refrain]
On my own, here we go
[Chorus]
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry, my face is numb
Fucked up and spun out in my room

On my own, here we go

"[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

[Verse 1]
Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

[Verse 2]
Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me
[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

[Bridge]
This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Intro: Alex Gaskarth]
Why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

[Verse 1: Alex Gaskarth]
Another day, 'nother headache in this hangover hotel
Gettin' used to the rhythm, yeah, I know this beat too well
Tunnel visions got me feeling like you're the only one I see
But I know what's missing when I'm swimmin'
In my lonely luxury

[Chorus: Alex Gaskarth]
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

[Verse 2: blackbear]
I'm addicted to the way you hurt, the way you contradict me
I swear everything look worse at night, I think I'm overthinking
I don't care who I might hurt along the way, I'm fuckin' sinking
Into every word, I don't care if you're lyin' when I'm drinking, so
Tell me pretty lies, look me in my face
Tell me that you love me, even if it's fake
And you can lead me on and leave these questions in my sheets
I'm under it, I made my bed and I'm still wonderin'
[Chorus: Alex Gaskarth]
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide?
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Why am I a sucker for all your lies?
Strung out like laundry on every line
Why do I come back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

[Bridge: Alex Gaskarth]
Thinkin' about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?
Dead, thinking about you, you're in my head
Even without you, I still feel dead
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

[Chorus: Alex Gaskarth]
I'm wondering, why do all the monsters come out at night?
Why do we sleep where we want to hide? (Hide)
Why do I run back to you, like I don't mind if you fuck up my life?

Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now!

Listen to me, because I'm telling you the truth!

You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

And we lay, we lay together

Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly

You're looking for a way to depress me, make me pay

You don't want me to be too close around you 'cause I would see
All the weak sides that you got, but which you're trying to hide
You know that I would nail you if I could nurse my pride

You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me

While one of us is fit the other's going insane

Thinking this way is not something that we both longed for

Oh, balanced boy is who I am
I'm like a mix between a wolf and a lamb
I starve myself in fall and spring
But with Yule and summer live like a king

I'm a mystery
Best not to be explored
A sweet melody
Played over dissonant chords

I am a balanced boy

I bear this complex paradox inside
I'm Jekyll and I'm Mr. Hyde
I will fabricate and I'll destroy

Every Friday entering the liquor store
My aim is to live my life fast
A way to escape the future and the past
A balanced boy
You are in full moon
Artificial joy
Is what you will consume

I'll manifest myself through charity

I compensate instability
Not everyone can be as balanced as me

Call me out, you stayed inside
The one you love is where you hide
Shot me down, as I flew by
Crash and burn, I think sometimes
You forget where the heart is

Answer ""no"" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say ""it's okay""

Waking up from this nightmare
How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me
And how broken my heart is?

[Bridge]
It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We came together, but you left alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend

"Hey Sweet Annie
Don't take it so bad
You know the summer's coming soon
Though the interstate is choking under salt and dirty sand
And it seems the sun is hiding from the moon

Your daddy told you
When you were a girl
The kind of things that come to those who wait
So give it a rest girl
Take a deep breath girl
And meet me at the Baystate tonight
And the snow is coming down
On our New England town
And it's been falling all day long
What else is new?
What could I do?
I wrote a valley winter song
To play for you

And late December
Can drag a man down
You feel it deep in your gut
Short days and afternoons spent pottering around
In a dark house with the windows painted shut
Remember New York
Staring outside
As reckless winter made its way
From Staten Island to the Upper West Side
Whiting out our streets along the way

And the snow is coming down
On our New England town
And it's been falling all day long
What else is new?
What can I do?
But sing this valley winter song
I wrote for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Verse 2]
And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Forgive me, I'm trying to find

The neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

[Bridge 2: Juliet Simms]
I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head

"Oh, it's time to let it go

The world's got a funny way of turning round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losing faith in everything I thought, I hoped and knew

Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willing to change

In sacrifice
False pretense, you'll hurt again
Stop pretending to deny

All along you know you thought you got the best of me
You were wrong and I'm laughing right in your face
I cannot believe you claimed you were my family

You, in somber resplendence, I hold

Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny

Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)

And we are fashioned in the image of the dons who have come before us

To learn the things about the universe I'll need

A victim of the chromosome prankster

Got jimmy hats from Pappy
So now I'm trigger-happy

Yeah, so...
You girlies wanna get with this nit-wit, got Cheez Whiz or not?

It's the deal, it's for real
You better listen what I'm telling you

"[Verse 1: Joel Madden]
As I walk through the valley of the
Shadow of L.A
The footsteps that were next to me have
Gone their separate ways
I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things don't
Always stay that way
I've done enough now to know this beautiful place isn't
Everything they say

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Madden]
I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels, I'm walking towards the light

[Chorus: Joel Madden]
Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city, was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong, but I swear I'm a believer

[Post-Chorus: Joel Madden]
Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered
[Verse 2: M. Shadows]
You're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
Underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard, the
Dead come back to life
To the praying Mother and the worried Father, let your
Children go
If they come back, they'll come home stronger, and if they
Don't, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Madden]
They say that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels, I'm walking towards the light

Where everything's nothing without you
I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

Through it all, I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

[Chorus]
I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

Thoughts ran unspoken, forever in vow
And pieces of memories fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have, so I won't let this go

With nowhere to go have come to an end

What you will find, what you will find

"[Chorus 1]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

[Verse 1]
The year was 1941
I was eight years old and far, far too young
To know that the stories of battles and glory
Was a tale a kind mother made up for her son
You see, dad was a traveling preacher
Teachin' the words of the Teacher
But mother had sworn he went off to the war
And died there with honor
Somewhere on a beach there
But he left once to never return
Which taught me that I should unlearn
Whatever I thought a father should be
I abandoned that thought like he abandoned me
By '47, I was fourteen
I'd acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine
I smoked until I threw up
Yet I still lit 'em up for thirty more years
Like a machine
[Pre-Chorus]
So right there you have it
That one filthy habit
Is what got me where I am today

[Chorus 2]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear those sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again
But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

[Verse 2]
Got married on my twenty-first
Eight months before my wife would give birth
It's easier to be sure you love someone
When her father inquires with the barrel of a gun
The union was far from harmonious
No two people could have been more alone than us
The years would go by and she'd love someone else
And I realized I hadn't been loved yet myself
From there it's your typical spiel
Yeah, if life was a highway, I was drunk at the wheel (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
I was helping the loose ends all fall apart (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Yeah, I swear I was destined to fail, and fail from the start
I bowled about six times a week
A bottle of Beam kept the memories from me
Our marriage had taken a seven-ten split
And along with my pride, the ex-wife took the kids
[Chorus 2]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear those sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again
But this is my deathbed (This is my deathbed), I lie here alone (Lie here alone)
If I close my eyes tonight (Close my eyes), I know I'll be home

[Bridge 1]
I was so scared of Jesus, but He sought me out
Like the cancer in my lungs that's killing me now
And I've given up hope on the days I have left
But I cling to the hope of my life in the next
Then Jesus showed up, said, ""Before we go up
I thought that we might reminisce
See, one night in your life when you turned out the lights
You asked for and prayed for My forgiveness""

[Bridge 2]
You ""cried wolf""
The tears they soaked your fur
The blood dripped from your fangs
You said, ""What have I done?""
You loved that Lamb
With every sinful bone
And there you wept alone
Your heart was so contrite
You said, ""Jesus, please forgive me of my crimes
Sanctify this withered heart of mine
Stay with me until my life is through
And on that day, please take me home with You""
[Chorus 3]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear You whisper to me, ""It's time to leave
You'll never be lonely again""
But this was my deathbed, I died there alone
When I closed my eyes tonight, You carried me home

[Interlude]

[Outro: Jon Foreman & Matt Thiessen]
I am the Way
Follow Me and take My hand
And I am the Truth

And I am the Life
And through Me, you'll live again

It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all

The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone

Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years

If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?
