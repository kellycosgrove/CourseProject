"[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
All the small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Just say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na

Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill

"[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

"[Intro]
Get ready for action!

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again? What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again? (Me) What's my age again?

"[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault
[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone95EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""

[Refrain]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Post-Chorus]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all

[Bridge]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

[Outro]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry)
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)204EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way

[Pre-Chorus]
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
[Pre-Chorus]
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed now!

But I'm okay, I'm okay!
I'm okay now, ""I'm okay now,"" but you really need to
Listen to me, because I'm telling you the truth!

Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate

From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)

What's the worst that I can say?

They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
