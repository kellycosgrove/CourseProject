"[Verse 1]
Cough up the rent Mr. Kent
And don't try to blame it on the government
Your wife is a clown she's in town
She gets with some other guy
Are you gonna finish your fat?
'Cause I'd like to give it to my kitty cat
The big fat look is coming back
You skinny people are screwed

And I know you're right
Yeah, I know it's time

Here we go again, another hump 'em dump 'em situation
Here we go again, another hump 'em dump 'em situation
Here we go again, here we go again
Now I know what you're like and I don't think I like it

[Verse 2]
The newspaper says to get bent
Man I'd like to say that to the President
He got the L in the House
I guess he already did
She looks like she finished her fat
She then turned around and ate my kitty cat
She coughed up a hairball or two
And laughed her way to the bank
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's right
Yeah, I know it's time

Here we go again, another hump 'em dump 'em situation

"[Intro]
The first star I see may not be a star
We can't do a thing but wait
So let's wait for one more

[Verse 1]
And the time, such clumsy time
In deciding if it's time
I'm careful but not sure how it goes
You can lose yourself in your courage

[Chorus]
When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

[Verse 2]
And the mindless comfort grows
When I'm alone with my great plans
And this is what she said gets her through it
""If I don't let myself be happy now, then when?
If not now, when?""

[Chorus]
When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again
Can you still feel the butterflies?
Can you still hear the last goodnight?

I close my eyes and believe
Wherever you are, an angel for

When the time we have now ends
When the big hand goes round again

"[Intro]
Hard days made me, hard nights shaped me
I don't know, they somehow saved me
And I know I'm making something
Out of this life they called nothing

[Verse 1]
I take what I want, take what I need
They say it's wrong, but it's right for me
I won't look down, won't say I'm sorry
I know that only God can judge me

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I make it through the day, will tomorrow be the same?
Am I just running in place?
And if I stumble and I fall, should I get up and carry on?
Will it all just be the same?

[Chorus]
Because I'm young, and I'm hopeless, I'm lost, and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast, that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I'm fallen, I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world, and I don't care

[Post-Chorus]
I don't care...
[Verse 2]
And no one in this industry understands the life I lead
When I sing about my past, it's not a gimmick, not an act
These critics and these trust fund kids try to tell me what punk is
But when I see them on the streets, they got nothing to say

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I make it through the day, will tomorrow be the same?
Am I just running in place?
And if I stumble and I fall, should I get up and carry on?
Will it all just be the same?

Because I'm young, and I'm hopeless, I'm lost, and I know this

"I know it's dark here, you know that I'm scared too
For some reason right now of everything but you
Right now you're all that I recognize

You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
And I wait here, and sometimes I get one

It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be

From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on

You know it starts here, outside waiting in the cold
Kiss me once in the snow, I swear it never gets old
And I will promise you I can make it warmer next year

You know I came here when I needed your soft voice
I needed to hear something that sounded like an answer
Now I stay here, and every day I get one

It's nothing I'll forget when the moon gets tired
You are stuck to me everyday
Believe in what I am because it's all I have today
And tomorrow who knows where we'll be
From here I can hardly see a thing
But I will follow anyone who brings me to you
For now, forever, for on and on and on

We can stay in 'till our southern summer wedding day

Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
And I don't want your money
If I was you, I'd run from me or rip me open
You'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we? We all need heroes, don't we?
But rest assured, there's not a single person here who's worthy

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face? What if I make a mistake?
If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves?
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you
But we can let the light illuminate these hopeless places

The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast

Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again

For what you did to me, and what I'll do to you
You get what everyone else gets, you get a lifetime, go!
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
Do you remember that day, when we met?
You told me this gets harder, well, it did
Been holding on forever
Promise me that when I'm gone, you'll kill my enemies

[Chorus]
The damage you've inflicted, temporary wounds I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I’m taking back the life you stole

We never got that far, this helps me to think all through the night
Bright lights that won't kill me now or tell me how
Just you and I, your starless eyes remain

[Verse 2]
Hip-hip-hooray for me, you talk to me
But would you kill me in my sleep? Lay still like the dead
From the razor to the rosary, we could lose ourselves
And paint these walls in pitchfork red
[Chorus]
I will avenge my ghost with every breath I take
I'm coming back from the dead
And I'll take you home with me
I'm taking back the life you stole

This hole you put me in wasn't deep enough
And I'm climbing out right now
You're running out of places
To hide from me

When you go, just know that I will remember you!
If living was the hardest part, we'll then, one day, be together!
And in the end, we'll fall apart just like the leaves changing colors!
And then I will be with you, I will be there one last time now!
When you go, just know that I will remember you!
I've lost my fear of falling, I will be with you, I will remember you!22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Craving double-feature love

Live with these uneasy feelings
Of the nightmare you’ve become

So go throw me to the lions
Listen for the screams
Show me how the scientist inside of you thinks
Anything but silence
Feel like I can’t breathe
Bring me ultra violence and a reason to bleed

You’re having trouble keeping focus
Craving me and all my blood
It’s raining cats and dogs of locusts
From that sicko up above
Burning up just like that fever dream

And unholy ghost above

So go throw me to the lions

Working all day for a mean little man
With a clip-on tie and a rub-on tan
He's got me running 'round the office like a dog around a track
But when I get back home, you're always there to rub my back

Hey Julie, look what they're doing to me
Trying to trip me up, trying to wear me down
Julie, I swear, it's so hard to bear it
And I'd never make it through without you around
No, I'd never make it through without you around

Hours on the phone making pointless calls
I got a desk full of paper that means nothing at all
Sometimes I catch myself staring into space
Counting down the hours 'til I get to see your face

Far away from each other every day?
Why must I spend my time filling up my mind

You might not think you're a supermodel
But you look like one to me
I'd rather have your picture on my phone
Than on the cover of a magazine

It's funny how all the things you would change
Are all things that are cute to me
And I know you don't believe me
And you think that I'm a fool
But I don't care

You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy
I'm not crazy
You're perfectly perfect to me

You brush it off every time I tell you
Your smile lights up the room
And I'm guessing that you don't even notice
That the whole world notices you
You think you're clumsy, I think you're cool
You say you're typical, but I think you rule
Sometimes I wonder if you'll ever believe
That I wrote this song for you

You'll never see in you what I see
The little things you do that make me go crazy

The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or was it all a dream?
The bombs are getting closer everyday
""That can never happen here"" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or was it all a dream?

Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough or is it all a dream?

To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream
So can we break this mold?
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?

We need a storm; let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light

Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?

[Bridge]
Is this what you call tact?
I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call
And end this conversation
There's nothing worse...
(that's right he said, that's right he said it)
I swear, you have no idea
The jealousy that became got me thinking
(that's right he said)
That you always had it way too easy

[Chorus]
Broken down in bars and bathrooms
All I did was what I had to
Don't believe me when I tell you
""it's just what anyone would do""
Take the time to talk about it
Think a lot and live without it
Don't believe me when I tell you
""it's something unforgivable""

[Outro]
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friends means I pulled the trigger
Best friends means you get what you deserve
Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!
Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Johnny says he's bound by only six strings to this world
Johnny says he keeps them always one turn out of tune
Johnny never listens to the kids that say
Johnny X ain't never done the right thing anyway

Johnny wears his leather like a crown of thorns
Johnny spends alot of time wishing he was never born
Johnny waits at Journal Square and tells himself again
Johnny you're the patron saint of spittin' in the wind

Johnny's got all the right scars but he'll never learn from them
Johnny's past is his guide but he can't remember where he's been
Johnny looks up through the steam of his caffine and says
""Life a train I barely caught just to find out I ain't got the fare""

I got my records of The King to keep me
The red red wine in the air is drifting
Four chords and the spite to use them
And just enough wisdom to ignore the truthEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Everybody is leaving from this town and from me
They've got the burning flame, they sure achieve their aim
You know that's tough for me to see
Oh, how I wish that I could do the same as them and go
Just pack my bags and good-bye
Get out fast or fade away real slow

'Cause what you see is what you get right here
Where a change is nowhere near
What you see is what you get from me
In this duckpond, leave me be

I pretend my life is perfect like the faces on TV
Yeah, that's the only way to face another day
Try to deny the misery
But those are the ways of looney's and like a clown
Yeah, I do act
No matter where I could be or would like to go
I'm stuck here. That's a fact

'Cause what you see is what you get right here
Where a change is nowhere near
What you see is what you get from me
In this duckpond, leave me be

I'm too weak I'm down on my knees
Too feeble for something new
Feels like there's nothing I can do
Keep on laughing 'bout me
Keep on doing your own
But someday I will be that one
Be that one
Yeah, someday I will be that one...
Be that one
Be that one
Yeah, someday I will be that one...
Be that one
Yeah, someday I will be that one...EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Intro]
Put on your war paint

[Verse 1]
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
[Verse 2]
Bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
""You broke our spirit,"" says the note we pass

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?

Are we falling apart
While we're pacing around in a funeral home?
Hey, I'll see you at another
Wake, and we'll just call it life

Now we're dancing around in our funeral home

Slow drift, you get a drink from the bar
To remember someone you hardly knew

Sick of all these words that will never matter

Hoping for a chance to think on time
And I'm tracing over your letter

She went away and then I took a different path

Did she ever marry ol' Whatshisface?

"Driver omkring här i linné
Jag söker någon sorts egen livskvalité
Ingen människa ser mig men en dag som den här känns det bra

Jag vet jag måste göra min grej
Spelar ingen roll vad folk säger mig
Det är nu eller aldrig
Det är allt på ett kort
Att det är nu eller aldrig gör steget för stort
Det ser ut som jag får vänta för evigt för att få nånting gjort

När ska jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Göra dom saker jag tror på?
När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar jag vill nå?
Så när kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Mitt liv för mig
För bara mig
Mitt liv för mig

Jag når Örat
Jag kör E20 norr
Det är stan i mitt hjärta av lycka och sorg
Men alla dom drömmar jag har finns ej där
Jag måste ta en chans i mitt liv
Måste på det där tåget innan det går förbi
Men jag förblir passiv
Står kvar där jag är
Fast jag sagt till mig själv: ""jag gör det, jag svär""
Jag vet att det är tragiskt att inte leva så som man lär
När ska jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Göra dom saker jag tror på
När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar jag vill nå?
Så när kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig?

Så säg att du förstår mig
Säg att du känner dig lika liten som jag
Säg att du förstår mig och jag gör det idag

När ska jag leva mitt liv för mig?
Göra dom saker jag tror på
När ska jag våga vara mig själv och fånga dom drömmar?
Jag vill ha det sagt
Jag måste börja tro på mig själv
Det är inte för sent för att fixa
När kommer jag leva mitt liv för mig?
När ska jag våga vara mig själv?
Så kanske jag lever mitt liv för migEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Oh, balanced boy is who I am
I'm like a mix between a wolf and a lamb
I starve myself in fall and spring
But with Yule and summer live like a king

I'm a mystery
Best not to be explored
A sweet melody
Played over dissonant chords

I am a balanced boy

I bear this complex paradox inside
I'm Jekyll and I'm Mr. Hyde
I will fabricate and I'll destroy
I am a balanced boy

I donate mighty to the poor
Every Friday entering the liquor store
My aim is to live my life fast
A way to escape the future and the past
A balanced boy
You are in full moon
Artificial joy
Is what you will consume

If you're a balanced boy

I bear this complex paradox inside
I'm Jekyll and I'm Mr. Hyde
I will fabricate and I'll destroy
I am a balanced, I am a balanced boy

In a world far from harmony
I'll best you with generosity
I'll manifest myself through charity
Yeah, in a world of absurdity
I compensate instability
Not everyone can be as balanced as me

Oh, I am a balanced boy

I bear this complex paradox inside
I'm Jekyll and I'm Mr. Hyde

He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

[Pre-Chorus]
Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Verse 2]
And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night

The neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

[Bridge 2: Juliet Simms]
I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head

Well I guess I'll go home now

But the bagheads down by Central Station
Are closer to where home is
It can be grim and send you West from time to time
Yeah, this place is such a shipwreck
But this shipwreck, it is mine

Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave, my anchor lays

But in a town with no way out
There's not much else to do anyway
If you're looking for a place to decay
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry

I've seen a punch or two, narrowly escaped a few
And if you can get the day off, I could show you a view
I remember the football games
The first time that I got laid
And the time J broke his finger drinking by the lake

Day by day, we grew to love this place
And where I make my grave is where my anchor lays
The sound of my youth echoes out through these empty streets
I guess I can't kick up the roots;

Då undrar man vad man ska göra
Man grunnar och tänker på tusen ideér
Och lyssna nu ska ni få höra:

Bygga raketer
Fightas med mumier
Stå i Eiffeltornet och rapa
Upptäcka något
Som aldrig funnits
Tvätta och bada en apa
Surfa på en våg
Lattja och ha kul
Leta i huven och stå
Hitta fåglar små
Måla jorden gul
Syrran får mer än hon tål!

Now the time has come, I just wish I could erase
All the damage done, all this pain all this heartache
Only just begun, it's been fun, we were fucked up and numb
There's a killer on the corner and he's looking for love
Yeah, he's looking for you, my love
[Chorus]
Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

[Bridge]
And to tell you the truth I lost my faith in you
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
And these unspoken lies appear at the worst times
You've gotta stop sneaking off on me
They're hiding just behind your eyes

[Chorus]
Where did you go once the lights went black?
Look what's become of me
I've grown to love your disappearing acts
Do one more, pretty please

[Outro/Chorus]
Where did you go once the lights went black?
You nearly gave us a heart attack
We thought you might have swam out to sea
You gotta stop sneaking off on me3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Intro]
Nobody likes you, everyone left you
They're all out without you, having fun

[Verse]
Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelly stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment checks
A flunky only along for the ride
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love is now in debt
On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse

[Pre-Chorus]
The town bishop's an extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life

[Chorus]
It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning, it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
There is nothing left to analyze
[Bridge]
Where will all the martyrs go when the virus cures itself?
And where will we all go when it's too late?
And don't look back

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America

It's not over 'til you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning, it's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late

Ayo, Mack, let the beat drop
Ladies and gentlemen, C5, Wayne time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone
Let me see your shoulders work
I mean, I don't know what y'all came here to do, but, uh
If you ain't got a lighter, what the fuck you smoking for?
We hot! (Haaa)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
""Knock, knock. Who's there?"" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

Hold your breath now, it's stacking up
Etched with marks, but I can deal

So maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing

Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be

"Oh Florida please be still tonight
Don't disturb this love of mine
Look how she's so serene
You've gotta help me out
And count the stars to form the lines
And find the words we'll sing in time
I want to keep her dreaming
It's my one wish, I won't forget this

I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away

So I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right

If luck is on my side tonight
My clumsy tongue will make it right
And wrists that touch
It isn't much, but it's enough
To form imaginary lines
Forget your scars, we'll forget mine
The hours change so fast
Oh God, please make this last
I'm outdated, overrated
Morning seems so far away

So I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories
Your lullaby for all the times
Hoping that my voice could get it right
Could get it right

You could crush me
Please don't crush me
'Cause baby I'm a dreamer for sure
And I won't let you down
I swear this time I mean it

And I'll sing a melody
And hope to God she's listening
Sleeping softly while I sing
And I'll be your memories

""Almost forty-eight hours have passed since the fall of an atomic bomb, and an attack upon the cities of man. And even now we are only beginning to see the aftermath of a massive display of destruction and power, that has uprooted our fresh outset of peace in civilized society. Despite the rubble, there is a predominant sense of wonder and marvel at the awesome nature of this technological terminus that has bewildered the very core of the human psyche.""

Sometimes, at night I let it get to me
And sometimes, I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night it had me down, I'm feeling numb
I can try, but sometimes that is not enough

No, sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough

And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up, or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom

[Verse 2]
And thinking back upon those days
Way, way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
'Cause I was always on the run
Well you know just what they say
""Just like father then like son""
Don't delude me with your sympathy
'Cause I can do this on my own
[Pre-Chorus]
And this won't be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
'Cause the truth is
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head so

Stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna

"Sex and violence has lost its charm, I need something to amuse
And war is boring, it's not enough, I need a shock down to my shoes

I'm long gone

So fuck me hard, I still want more
Sedation now is what I need
So I don't have to live with me

Take anything you want
Just don't show me who I am

Sedate me with anything so I don't have to live with me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free
Kill me with everything until there's nothing left of me
And tell me, tell me that I'm free

We have run from all our ills, but we won't run again
Toxic meat, political deceit, medicate me 'til I'm dead
And I'll take life from your can, just don't show me who I am

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All thе Fistagons, the bullets, and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff thе party ranks
More for Gore, or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

Gravity took something from your light
And I thought back to the years that we played baseball
How I tried, but I struck out so many times
But then once I hit the ball and it sailed over the fence, yeah
I felt my gut all filled up with pride

[Chorus]
So take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again
So take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again

[Verse 2]
And I dreamt about an abandoned hospital
And I met up with my friends to go inside
Well, I left something important back in Sunnyland, and
It's something that I know I'll never find

[Chorus]
So take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again
So take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again

[Bridge]
Can you tell me how long now 'til winter is done?
Wake me up when it's over and spring has begun
Give me all your bad days, it'll be over soon
Just as long as I have you
[Chorus]
So take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again
(Can you tell me how long now 'til winter is done?
Wake me up when it's over and spring has begun)
So take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again
(Give me all your bad days, I'll be over soon, just as long as I have you)

Oh, my love, please don't cry

I ripped out his throat
And called you on the telephone
To take off my disguise
Just in time to hear you cry when you

You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time, singing

I don't know much at all, I don't know wrong from right
All I know is that I love you tonight

There was police and flashing lights
The rain came down so hard that night
And the headlines read, ""A lover died...""
No tell-tale heart was left to find when you
[Pre-Chorus]
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
The night he died
You mourn the death of your bloody valentine
One last time, singing

He dropped you off, I followed him home
Then I stood outside his bedroom window
Standing over him, he begged me not to do
What I knew I had to do, because I'm so in love with you

Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me

Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more

I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

And that's about the time she walked away from me

What's my age again? What's my age again?

I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

To understand my, my intimate is no one

Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one
That needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret, who has to know?

The way she feels inside (Inside)
Those thoughts I can't deny (Deny)
These sleeping dogs won't lie (Won't lie)
And all I've tried to hide
It's eating me apart
Trace this line back

[Interlude]
I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret)

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret

"[Verse 1]
She, she screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

[Chorus]
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

[Verse 2]
She, she's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed

"You're on your own my little nightmare, you cannot stay here
It's far too bright for you
If they attack you, just lay there
Play dead dear, it's your only hope of pulling through

And seconds, they seem like a lifetime, a dream
Recurring, a dream that can't come true
And they'll pin it all on you
After all you've been put through

Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say, and now, miss
Susan A, you're losing every
Opportunity
To put us all away

Now run along my little nightmare, your job is done here
You've scared them all to death
If they revive them, just sit there
Just smile dear, make them thankful for every breath

This sentence may seem like a lifetime, a scream
That's curdling the blood they found on you
And your knives and clothing too
Charlie's broken .22
Sadie G, she's crazy, see?
That's what the white coats say, and now, miss
Susan A, you're losing every
Opportunity

Well they found you and they shipped you up the river the same way
That you've bound and gagged, you've shot and stabbed
You tried to set them free
But they've thrown away the keys
""He represented a God to me that was so beautiful that I'd do anything for him
I'd do anything for God
Even murder, if I believed it was right
How could it not be right if it is done with love?
I have no remorse for doing what was right to me
I have no guilt in me.""

"Don't tell me that this is your last chance to change
'Cause if you do, then you would be telling a lie
But

I warned you
What could happen if you should decide
To live your life from 9 till 5

And I mourn you
For that detail that is left unsaid
Is a reminder of the time you bled

Return to days when you knew you still felt alive
Reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

They sold you
Everything you need to fix you up
And you feel good now but you can't wake up
They found a way to reassure you (that everything would be okay)
Reach out today now I implore you to remember who you are

Return to days when you knew you still felt alive
Reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

So you felt it but you don't know
Why you can't explain at all
Why you felt it 'cause you don't know
No, you don't know
Break the walls between building atrophy
Causing all your problems to recede
Break the walls between (break the walls between)
Causing all your pain (causing all)
You'll never learn

Return to days when you knew you still felt alive
Reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

(Break the walls between building atrophy)
Take back the beat in your heart
Why fight when you can't be bought

(Causing all your problems to recede)
Take back the beat in your heart
Why fight when you can't be bought

(Break the walls between)
Take back the beat in your heart
Why fight when you can't be bought

(Causing all your pain)
Take back the beat in your heart
Why fight when you can't be bought1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
I dragged this lake looking for corpses
Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards
Pieces of planes and black box recorders
Don't lie
And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sixth senses
That sense DNA on barbed wire fences
Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect
That has no alibi

[Chorus]
But at the right place at the right time
I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine
And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit
For anyone but me
And at the right place at the right time
It will have been worth it to stand in line
And you won't have to stop
Saying ""I love cops"" for anyone but me
Your private eye

[Verse 2]
New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven
I watched flies fuck on channel 11
There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink
Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink
And there's no ring on the phone anymore
There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor
Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry

"I'm sniffing cigarettes in the dark again
I'm calling out your name
But I'll pretend someone's waiting
If you'd listen to just what I said
You might take the time to write it down
And call on me
When you're down
I am down
All your cigarettes on the window sill
I don't know if you were once a friend
Or just pretending
Open up that big old mouth of yours
Pills and razors
Marked the days as they were
Never-ending
When you're down
I am down
You should not forget
Every time we met
Shaking hands like friends
Then I swore I'd never go
I'd never go alone
Then you swore you'd never go
You'd never go alone
I've got your phone
And now I'll call your friends
I'll let know them know
That it was all for real
We weren't pretending
When you're down
I am down, down, down, down, down!
You should not forget
Every time we met
Shaking hands like friends
Then I swore I'd never go
I'd never go alone
Then you swore you'd never go
You'd never go alone
Then I swore I had it all, I
Swore I'd go alone

Shapes of something that is waiting for us
Flashes of light

"Twenty one, feeling down
I tell you nothing with a thousand words and I
Weaker get with every step
I waste my time on compact disc's and stale fish
I can't remember the last time I did something
That made me feel all right for longer than a few hours
If I only had the strength to make some muffins
Then I swear that I would share them with you now

Am I odd or am I not?
That's the question I spend time analyzing
I'm so soft but still I'm not
Living up to what people want me to be
Cause I'm busy with me, myself and I can't
Be understood by someone I don't know to well
So I'm shutting out the whole world just to play Nintendo
I've got these new games but I'm afraid you can't join me

These last few years I've been struggling
And I'm tired of keeping a low profile
So now it's time to show that I'm alive
I'm gonna change my life
Change my plans
Change my Vans
Even start to dance now
Change my thoughts
Change my sox
Change my moves
Even change my pro fighter Q for you
No its not for you
And change mine just for me
Change mine just for me

""What are you talking about? America is not going to be destroyed.""

""Never?
Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed
All great countries are destroyed, why not yours?
How much longer do you think your own country will last?
Forever?""

[Verse 1]

Block the entrances, close the doors
Seal the exits because this is war
All gave some, some gave all
But for what? I want to know

[Hook]

Carry on, don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight, bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
[Verse 2]

A folded flag, a purple heart
A family all but torn a part
I fought with courage to preserve
Not my way of life, but yours

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

The cowards preach from pedestals
With words like ""courage"" and ""resolve""
But what they meant was ""Fuck them all""
Because freedom isn't free
They send our daughters and our sons
To deserts under burning suns
A sacrificial slaughtering
To fill the pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy, are we so easily deceived?

They carry on

[Outro]
""You're a shameful opportunist! What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees.""

""You have it backwards. It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.""
Don't carry on, just walk away
How many more sent to their graves?
In this lesson ignored
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
What purpose did I serve?4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

On the N train down to Coney Island
With the money I saved
Gonna get me engraved
Drink down a lot of Basil Hayden
Get kicked out when I can't see straight and
What an island to be on
Under the neon
Red dragon tattoo
Is just about on me
I got it for you
So now do you want me
With nothing to prove
Will you be my honey
Oh yeah

In you I confide
Red dragon tattoo
I'm fit to be dyed
Am I fit to have you

I hear the man say ""you want to see the others""
A mermaid and a heart that says mother
But I don't know from maritime
And I never did hard time
I brought a .38 Special CD collection
Some Bactine to prevent infection
And in case I get queasy
A photo of Easy

Red dragon tattoo
Is just about on me
I got it for you
So now do you want me
With nothing to prove
Will you be my honey
Oh yeah

In you I confide

Am I fit to have you

Will you stop pretending I've never been born
Now I look a little more like that guy from KorN
If you came a little bit closer
You'd see it isn't painted on
Oh, no, no

You're hiding something, 'cause it's
Burning through your eyes
I try to get it out, but all I
Hear from you are lies

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were acting out your part
Once again, we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?

Catalyst, you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here

Your good intentions slowly
Turn to bitterness (Turn to bitterness)
Recurring episodes with
Each and every kiss (Let's go!)

And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were acting out your part
Once again, we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?

You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here

And I can't believe you pulled it off again
Or notice 'til it all sets in
You'll deny it 'til you're at your bitter end

Figured you were acting out your part
Once again, we're playing off emotion

Our ashes twisting in the air

Feeding the flames 'til there's no one to blame, it's on your hands
Lost in your lies, pay the price with our lives, you've gone mad

Four years, you think, for sure
That’s all you’ve got to endure
All the total dicks
All the stuck-up chicks
So superficial, so immature
Then when, you graduate
Ya take a look around and you say, “Hey, wait!
This is the same as where I just came from
I thought it was over! Aw, that's just great""

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who‘s the best dressed and who’s having sex
Who's got the money, who gets the honeys
Who‘s kinda cute and who‘s just a mess
And you still don’t have the right look
And you don’t have the right friends
Nothing changes but the faces, the names and the trends

Check out the popular kids
You’ll never guess what Jessica did!
And how did Mary Kate lose all that weight?
And Katie had a baby so I guess Tom’s straight!
And the only thing that matters
Is climbing up that social ladder
Still care about your hair and the car you drive
Doesn’t matter if you’re 16 or 35
Reese Witherspoon, she’s the prom queen
Bill Gates, captain of the chess team
Jack Black, the clown, Brad Pitt, the quarterback
Seen it all before
I want my money back!

The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who’s the best dressed and who’s having sex
Who’s in the club and who’s on the drugs
Who’s throwing up before they digest
And you still don’t have the right look
And you don’t have the right friends
And you still listen to the same shit you did back then
High school never ends

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985, 1985

[Verse 2]
She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows on the radio?

"Seth Shapiro got his law degree
He moved to Brooklyn from Schenectady, '93
Got some clients in the food industry
He says it's not the money, it's the recipes

He calls his mom, says he's doing fine
She's got somebody on the other line
Puts Coldplay on, pours a glass of wine
Curls up with a book about organized crime

When it's late, and it's hot
And a date with the Late Show's all that you've got
Don't give out, don't give up
One of these nights you might find someone to love

Beth McKenzie got the job of her dreams
Retouching photos for a magazine aimed at teens
It's Thursday night, she should be out on the scene
But she's sitting at home watching ""The King of Queens""

There's something wrong that she can't describe
She takes the contacts out of her eyes
Sets the alarm for 6:45
So she can get a little exercise

When it's late, and it's hot
And an hour in the shower is the best that you've got
Don't give out, don't give up
One of these nights you might find someone to love
And you're not the only one who's lonely

"[Verse 1]
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

[Verse 2]
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around

I came here by day, but I left here in darkness
And found you, found you on the way
And now, it is silver and silent, it is silver and cold
You, in somber resplendence, I hold

Oh, my beautiful one
Your sins into me
As a rapturous voice escapes, I will tremble a prayer
And I'll beg for forgiveness
(Your sins into me) Your sins into me

Light, like the flutter of wings, feel your hollow voice rushing into me
As you're longing to sing
So I, I will paint you in silver, I will wrap you in cold
I will lift up your voice as I sink

"Hot Sunni sun passes moaning mosque spire
B-company's pinned down under heavy fire
Underneath the palms there's improvised bombs
Because Jihad Johnny knows Yankee is a liar

An eye for an eye and blood for Texas tea
At the call to prayer al-Qaeda's on its knees
Isaac versus Ishmael, Allah versus Christ
Zarqawi's on the offense picking up the beat
There's celebratory fire and a purple thumb vote
Tom Cruise is on the saudi from the Gulf love boat
Smart bombs are coming, see the children running
The dead, they are all laughing, but we don't get the joke

I wish the boys were back, at least I know they're still alive

His mom is on the phone, his girl is all alone

On a mountain with some ancient man

Delayed at the gate

"Listen close, as the rain falls down to the ground

It's true
We are, we are destined to fail

We are, we are destined to fail

There is a problem here, with our society
The absence of my tears is my sobriety
I have a growing fear, and you're not helping me
Am I the only one who realizes it's true?

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen!

You're persecuting me, showing hypocrisy
I have a remedy for your insecurity
It's all the same sadly, nobody works for free
Am I the only one who realizes it's true?

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen!
Let your light shine through me
Take this hate I can't release
Help me make the blind see
Misery loves its company

When I dream, I see dawn turn
Into dusk, into dusk!

Beat but I'm not broken
Guide me through with your hand
Lead with your words spoken
Show me how to listen!

Let your light shine through me
Take this hate I can't release
Help me make the blind see

Keep your wings, always keep them by your side

Remember, before you fly, you'll fall
Before you walk, you'll crawl
Before you fly, you'll fall

"[Verse 1]
All these people are passed out
On the floor in my hotel room
I don't know half of them
But they all wanna know me
And it's four in the morning
I'm just trying to fix myself
What the hell did I do?
I’m the life of the party
I’m the life of the party

[Chorus]
Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I’ll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind
Thrills don’t come for free
The price you pay for dreams
In a sea of strangers
I can’t find me anymore, anymore
I can’t find me anymore

[Verse 2]
I keep thinking about you
How you level me out sometimes
When I'm out of my head
And I don't wanna face it
You said it's all for a reason
What the fuck is the reason now?
Coming down, bring me back
I'm the life of the party
I’m the life of the party

Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I’ll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind
Thrills don’t come for free

I can’t find me anymore, anymore
I can’t find me anymore

Now it's four in the morning
I'm trying to fix myself
What the hell did I do?
I'm the life of the party
It's so hard to imagine
Who I'd be if I walked away
Never know what it's like
To be the life of the party
I'm the life of the party
I'm the life of the party

Somewhere in between
Who I used to be
And who I’ll be tomorrow
When the champagne blows my mind
Thrills don’t come for free
The price you pay for dreams

I can’t find me anymore, anymore
I can’t find me anymore, anymore

That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way

The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)

You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)

Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

Well we've all heard about
How the guys in the band
Weren't the popular kids in school
And now you hate your parents
Cause of the way you turned out
But in the end the blame's on you

And we all sympathize with your torn-apart hearts
And your really artistic worldly views

It's super cool to be mad these days

Don't hate us 'cause we're happy
Don't hate us 'cause we're beautiful

Or if we go the extra mile
To make someone feel better

And if you're hearing what I'm saying then
I want to hear you say, ""I'm gay!""

"I'm throwing away pictures
That I never should have taken in the first place
And it's cold in my apartment
As I'm changing all the colors
From the brightest reds to grays

Well it's 3 o'clock on Monday morning
I'm just hoping you're not seeing his face
I've been getting calls in these hotel rooms
Long enough to know that it was him
That took my place

And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts

And I'm burning all the letters
Hoping that I might forget her and the bad taste
That she left when she was leaving me
A life of barely breathing as she walked
Out of this place

And you dropped the note and we changed key
You changed yourself and I changed me
I really didn't see us singing through this
Then you screamed the bridge
And I cried the verse
And our chorus came out unrehearsed
And you smiled the whole way through it
I guess maybe that's what's worse
And I hope this makes you happy now
That the flame we had is burning out
And I hope you like your pictures facing down
As even broken hearts may have their doubts

And I'm taking all your memories off the shelf
And I don't need you or anybody else
So take a look at me
See what you want to see
When you get home

Take me home
I'd rather die than be with you
Take me home
You have a problem with the truth
Take me home
Because this happens every time
I knew it would...
I knew it would...

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms, give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

And you can't get another try

So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you oughta stay

And after all the blood that you still owe
Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa

When you go, and would you even turn to say
""I don't love you like I did yesterday""?

""I don't love you like I loved you yesterday""?

"While I down Kentucky bourbon, I am waiting for a call
And the moon and stars tonight are playing shadows on the wall
With the moon the way it is, dear, would you answer out of spite?
Or are you feeling lonely tonight?
Cuz I remember last time we were out under the stars
Driving crooked down the highway, drinking beer in roadside bars
Now and then I wonder why this painful memory
Can never find its way to you from me

And I can't dial the phone just now, even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today, you'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on you

Well the house I'm ringing up from is a half a mile from you
But with the reception I'm getting, might as well be Timbuktu
And behind the door of your home is a strange and foreign land
Where you speak a language I don't understand

And I can't dial the phone just now, even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today, you'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on you

Now I'm goin down to Jimmy's bar like a thousand other times
With an appetite for poison and a suitcase full of dimes
And I'll wait there by the payphone with one hundred other guys
With those sorry hung up teardrops in our eyes
And I can't dial the phone just now, even though I know your number
Can't bring my broken heart to be untrue
Like you did today, you'll say goodbye the same old way
Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on you

Ever since you hung up on me, I'm hung up on youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Well, I pretend I can't hang up the phone
'Cause if I do then he gets you
And I'll be in this room alone
Staring at the carpet
Wondering how they made it
And you would say I should not be afraid
I'm better off alone and free
'Cause no one can put up with me
And your mom don't like me either
Now I don't have to meet her
You and me
We end up in catastrophe
But I have got one more thing to add
Okay, so I'm a jerk and I'm a weirdo
And even if I'm lucky I'll amount to zero
But I thought that you'd love me anyway
I'm so not even worth it
But baby, no one's perfect
Yeah, I thought that you'd love me anyway
Anyway
You're not the type of girl who takes advice
Still all that shit your parents said
Still bouncing round inside your head
""You two will never make it, if you build it, he will break it""
You and me
They sum us up so poignantly
But I have got one more thing to add
Okay, so I'm a jerk and I'm a weirdo
And even if I'm lucky I'll amount to zero

I'm so not even worth it
But baby, no one's perfect
Yeah, I thought that you'd love me anyway

Maybe you'll never play the guitar
And maybe you'll never sing in harmony with me
Maybe you can't rock the AC/DC

"[Chorus]
I remember when we met you looked at me and I went numb
And I had to push reset 'cause my brain switch was stuck on dumb
Lucky for me you did not run

[Verse 1]
I look away then peek again
Don’t have a clue, don't have a plan
I see her smile, is it for me?
No one is standing in vicinity
I start to think there is a chance
She's giving more than a passing glance
You’ll mess it up, you always do
No one ever likes the real you

[Chorus]
Then she said she thinks I'm cute and I am fun
So I had to push reset 'cause my brain switched from dumb to numb
Lucky for me she didn't run

[Verse 2]
I start to feel some confidence
A minute later we were holding hands
Don't have have the words, I'm full of doubt
Sooner or later they will kick us out
Where do we go, another spot
We better leave before we get caught
Times up, we're headed out
I'm getting ready for the let down
[Chorus]
Then she said if you want me you must move slow
But I’m willing to accept there’s something here that could be love
Lucky for me she didn't run

[Verse 3]
I bet she wishes she did
You know I went and put a ring on it
Tiffany’s got that paycheck
I guess my game is strong
I'm just a sucker for a smart girl with a big fat brain in her skull
She made a hard man soft
I used to rock it till the wheels fell off
Now I'm hanging out in the slow lane
But don't feel sorry for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm lying on the table
With everything you said
Keeping in mind the way that it felt
When the most I could do was to just blame myself

So we're talking forever
And you almost feel better
But better's no excuse for tonight
You see, it’s never bad enough
To just leave or give up
But it's never good enough to feel right

Somehow, we're tilted and the ringing in my ears
Won't go away, it's happening again

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah

Go find another way, price you pay

"[Intro]
Far in, ohhhh. Wait, we singing?
Take everything left from me!
All! To! Blame!

[Verse 1]
How can we still succeed taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis, selling all the hate that we breed
Super-size our tragedies (you can't define me, or justify greed)
Bought in the land of the free (land, free)

[Chorus]
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

[Post-Chorus]
We want it all with no sacrifice!

[Verse 2]
Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
Stand to salute, say thanks to the man of the year
How did we all come to this? (you can't define me, or justify greed)
A greed that we just can't resist (resist)
[Chorus]
And we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We're hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

[Post-Chorus]
We want it all, everyone wants it all, with no sacrifice!

[Bridge]
Tell me now, what have we done
We don't know, I can't allow
What has begun to tear me down, believe me now
We have no choice left with our backs against the wall!

[Chorus]
And now we're all to blame
We've gone too far from pride to shame
We're hopelessly blissful and blind, when all we need
Is something true to believe

[Post-Chorus]
Don't we all, everyone, everyone, we will fall

[Outro]
Because we're all to blame
We've gone too far, from pride to shame
We're trying so hard, we're dying in vain
We want it all, everyone, don't we all...6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

[Chorus]
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

[Verse 2]
As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

[Chorus]
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

Dive right back into you
And now I know you

Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

"It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I needed strength to change my mind, but these ghosts stick to me like glue
Hating life, believing I was no good

It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone

It was a cloudy night, or so it looked to me
I felt so lost, I couldn't say why
I built this cloud to live in, it was a bunch of lies in my mind
The world wants me to believe it, so I had to change my mind

It was a darkness all my own
A song played on the radio
It went straight to my heart
I carried it with me until the darkness was gone

I built this cloud, I can break it
The world can't change how I feel
Because I know it's a lie
My heart is realEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Let the record play
Let the record play

The way that you dance, the way that you move
The way that you stare at me across the room
You carry Dior bags, and you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
I got a model 26, but she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly, tucked inside in my waist

[Chorus]
And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
But the record keeps playing the same old song
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

[Verse 2]
Now she sweating my friends and my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin, my Adam Barton tattoos
But she can't say ""What's up?"" So what does she do?
She just stays posted up the other side of the room, I got AMC
Tattooed on my hand, I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana
[Chorus]
And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
But the record keeps playing the same old song
They say ""Ah ha, ah ha""
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

[Verse 3]
She, she, she don't want to talk about it
He, he, he wants to fight about
Me, me, I don't want to fight about it
I just want to be up out it, I'm just trying to stay up out it
Step out the wagon, you know the boy starts to hate, the girl that
Came with him, they like that's not the boy she dates, they get to
Fighting and swearing and now the boyfriend is staring
The disco ball on the ceiling looks like the chain that I'm wearing

But the music keeps playing
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain

We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

You can't fill your cup until you empty all it has

So I offered up a plan:

And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over

When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind

Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it or leave it, you can't understand a pretty face
But you do, so carry on, and on, and on

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me
On, and on, and on, and on
Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

[Chorus]
So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will

[Verse 2]
Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one, and one, and one, and one
[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill

Step back to see what's going on

Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
But what else are we supposed to do?

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure anymore

Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
Now that I find no way so bad
I don't think I knew what I had

Never end up being what we chose

I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side

From the tongue, it slips some simple twist of fate
To shape and shake the room we were standing in
And I remember then the silence made me weightless
In the tonic of you once again
Where ignorance was bliss
Ignorance was this place we could exist and then surrender
Do you remember?

The day you said it
That's when I knew, that's when I knew, that's when I knew

Man, shit gets real when you're alone
(I wonder if you'll ever know)
There's these voices in my head
They're screaming words I should've said
But I don't know
I can't let go
And you are down
Your taste was in my mouth
The lipstick on the window
You were gone

Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you)

Another night, another dream wasted on you

But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

[Verse 2]
I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us - not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)

And I will always remember you now, remember you now

I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen

When the lights go off, I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger, go on and play the leader
'Cause you know it's what you're good at, the low road for the fast track
Make every second last

"[Verse 1: Trenton Woodley]
I wonder, can you daydream at night?
Lying awake, I've had too much time
I'm watching picture shows in the shadows
Dance for the crowd tonight
Imagination is such a vivid place to hide
While stars watch over you

[Chorus: Trenton Woodley]
Through silent homes
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
The way I've walked before
Sleeping with saints and apparitions between the walls
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
I promised not to wake you
So I'll walk light, just so you can hear

[Verse 2: Trenton Woodley]
The rats in the roof and termites in the ceiling
We'll hear everything except what we need to hear
Sleeplessness is for the restless and I'm just fine
Left to wander, aimless in unconsciousness
There's spiders crawling from the corners of my eyes
(Let them weave their little webs)
(To snatch the sunlight from the lens)
I'm staring at the ceiling cause I'm fed up with the sight
(Weigh my eyelids back to sleep, sealed by silken silver threads)
While stars watch over you
[Chorus: Trenton Woodley]
Through silent homes
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
The way I've walked before
Sleeping with saints and apparitions between the walls
The lights are out, but I walk these halls
Cast the sheep out of your mind
Count the wolves and we'll sleep tonight

[Verse 3: Tyler Carter & Jonny Craig]
I stumble in and I stumble out
Of unfamiliar rooms in foreign houses, but I'm at home (Foreign houses)
Now a ghost has left behind his sheets
Unrequited, until I wake up somewhere
Until I wake up somewhere I know I've never been

I'll stay 'til sleep takes over you
And I'll walk while stars watch over you

The lights are out, but I walk these halls

Sleeping with saints and apparitions between the walls

Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime

[Verse 1]
I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it
I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage
I wanna drive this car right over the edge
Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet
I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic
Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic
I never meant to be hypocritical
This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical

[Pre-Chorus]
And just like that, I know there's no turning back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it

[Chorus]
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'Til I hit an all-time low
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad
Once in a lifetime
[Verse 2]
I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it
I tell myself every night, I could live without it
I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness
But every time I do, I make another mess

[Pre-Chorus]
And just like that, I know there's no looking back
We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it

[Chorus]
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
Take it fast and kill me slow
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
'Til I hit an all-time low
Once in a lifetime, never the right time
To throw out everything we had
Try to forget you, gotta pretend to
I hope a heart only breaks this bad

Dear Bobbie
Do you remember when you were young and very pretty? I do
I remember pleated skirts, black and white saddle shoes
Do you remember dancing half the night?
I do, I still think of you when we dance
Although we can't jitterbug as we did then

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when
How long has it been?
1945, you opened my blue eyes
To see a whole new life
Do you remember when
I told you this that night?
That if you're by my side
When every day begins
I'll fall for you again
I made a promise when
I told you this that night

[Chorus]
I'll be fine
Cause when i die, then i die loving you
It's alright, i'll be fine
When i die then i die loving you
Loving you, loving you
[Spoken]
Do you remember the times we would give up on each other then get back together
Then we finally was married in 1949
We drove the yellow convertible on our honeymoon
Do you remember? I do

[Verse 2]
Life has led us here
Together all these years
This house that we have made
Holds 20,000 days
The memories we've saved
Since life has led us here

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm coming home to you
Slipping off my shoes
Resting in my chair
I see you standing there
The silver in your hair
I'm coming home to you
When i lay tonight
When i close my eyes
I know the sun will rise
Here or the next life
As long as you're still mine, then it's alright
[Chorus]

[Spoken]
You have grey hair now
But you are a beautiful woman
And the years have been good to both of us
We walk slow now, but we still have each other
The glue of love is still bonding us together
Love is what i remember. Do you remember?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace

"I got ideas how this planet works
It gives perspective on all the racist jerks

Some brains are fast, means that some brains are slow

This is the rational side of me, I guess
The sense they barely use when playing chess
Luck's in the end I know there's also the other side of me
And to me it's an emotional sensibility

And that's the side of me I turn to
When I read about the world, well
That's not my cup of tea
Yeah, it's the side of me I take
That tells me you've got it wrong

In this carousel the silence is so surreal

And it's been hours now and we still know nothing

And we'll peel back the dressings so we can see
The kind of things that the surgeons see
When the blood work won't give us the answers, whoa
They'll never tell us, 'cause they don't know what's killing us
[Verse 3]
My heart's at a million miles an hour and we brace for the impact
It makes time stand still
Forcing momentum into a moment
So for a split second I see your face
In between all the broken glass, hanging like a mobile
And this is a picture we'll never quite forget

[Bridge]
The surgeons pick, they pick at my body
(Their fingers dance, they dance all around me)
The surgeons pick, they pick at my body
(Their fingers dance, they dance all around me)
Hold still while they pick at my body
(Their fingers dance, they'll dance all around me)
Hold still while they pick at my body
They'll dance all around me
Breathe your anesthetic words to slow us down
Tear back the skin to find the chase, a pulse back home

[Chorus]
I'll never say that you make me sick
But you're turning all the questions to cancers, whoa
Someone call in the emergency
And we'll peel back the dressings so we can see
The kind of things that the surgeons see
When the blood work won't give us the answers, whoa
They'll never tell us, 'cause they don't know what's killing us6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Rides a kid with a knack for invention
A super-powered mind

So many things to do and not much time
So off the ground, up in the air
Out into the atmosphere

"[Verse 1]
It starts with a spark
A breath and a moment of still
A flicker, a glow as the oxygen spills
Through a delta of spindles and stone
Kindled from nothing in a whisper of smoke
And there a gift ignites, a cursive thought takes flight
And there's a dancer twisting in between the spines
Give her the breather's kiss, and watch her spirit lift
She'll take over the stage and she'll own the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Learning how to make a name
From the words we can't keep in
Learning how to strike a flame
And draw her fire from nothing

[Chorus]
I don't know where to begin
To make these words take shape
How to nurture a flame
To raise it to a blaze
That on the clearest night can be seen forever
I don't know where to begin, or begin again

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
It's not enough
'Cause outside the night is still cold
The fog is collected on the sill
Feed the house to the fire to let out the light
Consumed and inspired, burned magnesium white
Let it spill from the hearth, take the curtains
The carpet to fuel the insatiable fire inside
We'll set fire to a hill, so intense that it will be
The brightest star on this side of the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Learning how to make a name
From the words we can't keep in
Learning how to strike a flame
And draw her fire from nothing

To raise it to a blaze

"[Spoken]
Thoughts are the shadows of feelings
Always darker, emptier, and simpler
I don't care if they're fake or real
I just thank them for showing up at all
I have black periods. Who does not?
But they are not a part of me;
They are not a part of illness, but a part of my being
What am I saying?
I have the courage to have them
Four o' clock in the morning. This sucks.""

I can't go on
You set my head too heavy
I need that song
Those trusty chords could pull me through
And early on
They saw the warning signs and symptoms all day long
We'd sit and dream of better days

[Refrain]
When we'd hit the ground running on empty
Stories we've been told
And all those nights we spent together
Never felt this fucking cold
When we let the car run in the driveway
Kiss you one last time
Before we brought the horses in before
The storm of '59, of '59, of '59

These limbs have grown too heavy

I've been stuck in the middle pages
Hung up on a cross that I created
Built out of the bones that I've been breaking
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can't see it
You might be down and out but you're still breathing

[Pre-Chorus]
If you write the story
You'll find out we're all stuck on the same page

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes things will bend you
But trust me you'll be fine
'Cause I've been moving mountains that I once had to climb
And life's not out to get you
Despite the things you've been through
'Cause what you give is what you get
And it doesn't make sense to make do

The walls are caving in again
Happens every now and then
Always got me feeling like I'm fucked (fuck)
Falling in and out of bed sleep so hard
Feel like I'm dead
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough
Say life has lost its meaning
And that's true if you believe it
But someday you will stand above your demons
(You're not beneath this)

You can't change what's been

Do you ever feel out of place

And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room

That no one hears your screamin'?

No, you don't know what it's like

You don't know what it's like

Are you sick of feelin' so left out?

[Verse 2]
Let's amend the classic story
Close it so beautifully
I'll let animosity unwind
Steal away the darkened pages
Hidden so shamefully
I'll still feel the violence of the lies

[Chorus]
I can't stand my laughter as they cry
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes
And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolence
[Chorus]
I can't stand my laughter as they cry
My soul brings tears to angelic eyes
And miles away my mother cries
Omnipotence nurturing malevolenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that

"[Verse 1]
Sat on the stack, held it all back
Let it all go to prevent a crack
And it seems I miss you dearly
Youth on my side so I'll find the time
I'll grow up someday but for now I'm fine
I just wish that you were near me

[Verse 2]
Glory days, oh glory days behind me
Set deep but tainted skin
I'm well aware so don't remind me how I can't seem to win
Accept defeat but curse the cracks up empty streets
And I don't wanna tell the same sad story
Even if I did you'd just ignore me

[Chorus]
I wear myself out trying to find an ending
And I'll work this out when I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There's more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight's 20/20

[Verse 3]
My old man once said, ""Take heed
Don't wait until you're just like me
To look back over history with nothing but regret.""
So all my friends say ""Fuck forever. Live today and die together.""
We don't wanna tell the same sad story
Heard it all before and that's fucking boring

I wear myself out trying to find an ending
And I'll work this out when I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There's more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight's 20/20

"[Intro]
If you’ve ever been in love
Or ever hope to be in love
Here’s a story you’ll love with all your heart

[Verse 1: Jordan Pundik]
Couples on their backs in the park
Lay on blankets bought
On a date the day before
A routine I’ve been longing for
Can’t help but to glance
From the corner of my resentful eyes
Guess it’s all perspective but
It’s you I never get enough
We’re always far apart

[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]
We’ve got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We’ve got a vicious love

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
When I go out alone
And see them sharing meals
Like Lady and the Tramp
Hate their loving eyes
Wishing it was you and I
Add tip to my receipt
Fold it up behind a picture of us
Guess it’s all perspective but
Together though we rarely touch
Hard not to fall apart
[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]
We’ve got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We’ve got a vicious love

[Bridge: Jordan Pundik]
I could have given up a thousand times
In the past that was so easy
When the thought came to my mind
There was no convincing me
Plant my feet to face it all
Side by side or a phone call
Living in tension with you
Still feels better
Better than I’ve ever known

[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]
We’ve got a vicious love
We mix our tears with blood
No clock will stop for us
It ticks by
We fight as hard as we love
We’ve got a vicious love2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I need somebody, need somebody
Need somebody to pick me up
And no one to let me down
I need something different
Someone, somewhere, and somehow
I need my world just to open up
I need just to find my way
Cause now or never
Never means that it's too late

[Chorus]
And maybe it's not that far
And maybe it's not that hard
Maybe we're close to finding out who we are
Maybe it's the world apart
Maybe it's straight up in the stars
I don't care how far
They have planes, trains, & cars
That'll get me where I'm going

[Verse 2]
I need a reason, need a reason
Need a reason for waking up
Need a reason for getting out
Need a reason to pull the sheets right up instead of down
I need my eyes just to open up
To see that it's not a race
Cause now or never
Never means that it's too late
[Chorus]
And maybe it's not that far
And maybe it's not that hard
Maybe we're close to finding out who we are
Maybe it's the world apart
Maybe it's straight up in the stars

"He was only 16 and he knew he wasn't like anyone else
Listening to his records in his room he knew
Something had to change somewhere or he would go insane
But when some years slipped by and he still felt the same
People and money came and went but the only thing that stayed the same
Were the feelings he felt when those records played

He drinks ‘til he falls down
Oi oi oi oi, his name is Lamar Vannoy!
He's looking for something and
He's gonna find it
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy!

Me and Lamar in NYC on the avenue
Talking about nothing much
With a bag of brew the New York wind
Will blow and he will wear his engineer boots
Motorcycle jacket black jeans nowhere to go
Nothing to do
So much has gone
Wrong and so much is bad but sharing
This music with Lamar there is so
Much we have
He drink's and think's
About a girl who lies
Oi oi oi oi and his name is Lamar Vannoy
He'll wake up and
Go to work with a swollen brain
Oi oi oi oi
And his name is Lamar Vannoy
He drinks ‘til he falls down

"[Chorus 1]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

[Verse 1]
The year was 1941
I was eight years old and far, far too young
To know that the stories of battles and glory
Was a tale a kind mother made up for her son
You see, dad was a traveling preacher
Teachin' the words of the Teacher
But mother had sworn he went off to the war
And died there with honor
Somewhere on a beach there
But he left once to never return
Which taught me that I should unlearn
Whatever I thought a father should be
I abandoned that thought like he abandoned me
By '47, I was fourteen
I'd acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine
I smoked until I threw up
Yet I still lit 'em up for thirty more years
Like a machine
[Pre-Chorus]
So right there you have it
That one filthy habit
Is what got me where I am today

[Chorus 2]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear those sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again
But this is my deathbed, I lie here alone
If I close my eyes tonight, I know I'll be home

[Verse 2]
Got married on my twenty-first
Eight months before my wife would give birth
It's easier to be sure you love someone
When her father inquires with the barrel of a gun
The union was far from harmonious
No two people could have been more alone than us
The years would go by and she'd love someone else
And I realized I hadn't been loved yet myself
From there it's your typical spiel
Yeah, if life was a highway, I was drunk at the wheel (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
I was helping the loose ends all fall apart (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Yeah, I swear I was destined to fail, and fail from the start
I bowled about six times a week
A bottle of Beam kept the memories from me
Our marriage had taken a seven-ten split
And along with my pride, the ex-wife took the kids
[Chorus 2]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear those sad memories still haunting me
So many things I'd do again
But this is my deathbed (This is my deathbed), I lie here alone (Lie here alone)
If I close my eyes tonight (Close my eyes), I know I'll be home

[Bridge 1]
I was so scared of Jesus, but He sought me out
Like the cancer in my lungs that's killing me now
And I've given up hope on the days I have left
But I cling to the hope of my life in the next
Then Jesus showed up, said, ""Before we go up
I thought that we might reminisce
See, one night in your life when you turned out the lights
You asked for and prayed for My forgiveness""

[Bridge 2]
You ""cried wolf""
The tears they soaked your fur
The blood dripped from your fangs
You said, ""What have I done?""
You loved that Lamb
With every sinful bone
And there you wept alone
Your heart was so contrite
You said, ""Jesus, please forgive me of my crimes
Sanctify this withered heart of mine
Stay with me until my life is through
And on that day, please take me home with You""
[Chorus 3]
I can smell the death on the sheets covering me
I can't believe this is the end
I can hear You whisper to me, ""It's time to leave
You'll never be lonely again""
But this was my deathbed, I died there alone
When I closed my eyes tonight, You carried me home

[Interlude]

On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings at someone's beck and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere, this fate, I lost control

[Pre-Chorus]
We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around
I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured (Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-oh)
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore (Fight this anymore)
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here (Be here) anymore

[Verse 2]
On hand and foot we answered every single call
And weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone (We will all be gone)
Won't back down, won't take no for answers anymore (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
These walls close, we pace back and forth

I don't wanna be here anymore (Be here anymore)
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured (Oh-ah-oh, oh-ah-oh)
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore (Fight this anymore)
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here (Be here) anymore

The point where we break gets closer everyday
But where do we go?
But where do we go?

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me

I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, ""Hah, it's our time, nigga""
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is ""sayonara, nigga""
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant

Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
""Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt""
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me

Gone their separate ways

Always stay that way

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels, I'm walking towards the light

You're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
Underneath these lights

Children go
If they come back, they'll come home stronger, and if they
Don't, you'll know

I thought that I found myself under something new
Just one more line I repeat over and over again
'Till I'm blue in the face with a choking regret
As I talk in circles 'round you on my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

It's about time that you got sick of me
No longer fun, and so far from interesting
I thought that I found me a cure for feeling old
Just one more line to keep me sleeping loudly and cold
In disgrace with a shameful regret
As I talk in tongues to myself in my bed
Can't say I blame you one bit when you kept it all inside
When you left that night

Somehow we lost our heads for the last time
And all that followed fell like mercury to hell

Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays, you don’t even faze me
It’s all the same, and I don’t stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension (with all I've done...)

[Pre-Chorus]
With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become

[Chorus]
So, all that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

[Post-Chorus]
Get ready, 'cause this is war
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Get ready, 'cause this is war
Get ready, 'cause this is war

[Chorus]
All that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

[Outro]
Get ready, 'cause this is war, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
Get ready, 'cause this is war, everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready, 'cause this is war...2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
Pry the darkness from my eyes
Divided, let the light seep in
Trees devoid of branches and hollow hives
Endless black and empty beds
It's not the same, something's changed
I never used to be able to see past the trees
A thousand unfamiliars are lying thick on the air
And I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
I'll tear apart the town then sleep, then sleep alone

[Verse 2]
If I'm a flame, I'm a forest fire
Speaking savage tongues as I emerge from the hills
I am an avalanche
I am unchained, I'm awoken, I'll unleash hell
So I roar, pin back my ears and stone by stone
I'll tear it all, I'll tear it apart

[Chorus]
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
I'll tear apart the town then sleep, then sleep alone
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
[Bridge]
I've lost faith, the forest's changed
My stomach's empty, I'm feeling faint
I've lost heart, the forest's scarred
I hear no birds, just TVs, and cars
I've lost faith, the forest's changed
My stomach's empty, I'm feeling faint
I've lost sight, the forest's died
The brambles are bare, and I'm hollow inside
Each breath rattles like dice in my chest
Each breath gambled, unwinding 'til death

[Chorus]
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?
This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home
(This doesn't look like home, this doesn't look like home)
Is our skin to keep the world out or our bodies in?

One, two, three, four...

[Verse 1]
Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

[Chorus]
Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

[Post-Chorus]
A call across the Underclass!

[Verse 2]
Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one, I'm just another reject
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
Unsung against the grain, I'm here to rise against
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere)
Burning the flag (of the degeneration)
Everyone sing (the anthem of no future)
Down with the mass ('cause we're not listening)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

May I have your attention please?
I pledge allegiance to the Underclass as your hero at large!

We're the saints of degeneration
We don't owe anyone an explanation
Fuck elitists, we don't need this

Passed out in our school clothes
So we'd wake up in our Sunday's best
I never asked for your opinion, I just got it and I get it
You move slow like daytime drama
And I'm boring like his songs
So while I'm taking you for granted
We'll be humming along

Well cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here
So reckless (so reckless), so
So thoughtless (so thoughtless)
So careless, I could care less
Cross my heart and hope to
I'm lying just to keep you here

Well she's so heartless
And I could care less

So paint your face up something elegant
And this town maybe a darker shade of red
Cause a long night means a fist fight
Against your pillow and my pearly whites
I want to hear you scream you like me better on my knees
So let us pray
(We don't believe in second chances)
So let us pray

Don't you ask me
Don't you move (anywhere)

One of us never did it but we're taking it all
And tell me why you never promised that you wanted it all
And her eyes never batted when she said it
It's a long night, open, know it
This glass house is burning down (open all night, know it)
You light the match, I'll stick around (open all night, know it)
I'll give you everything you want (open all night, know it)

In a sea of sound
When I woke up alone
I had everything
A handful of moments

And a tongue like a nightmare that cut like a blade
In a city of fools

But they tore me apart like a hurricane
A handful of moments I wish I could change but I was carried away

Give me therapy
I'm a walking travesty
But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me
And you can keep all your misery

As I faced the crowd
I think that keeping this up could be dangerous
I'm flesh and bone
I'm a rolling stone
And the experts say I'm delirious

But I'm smiling at everything
Therapy, you were never a friend to me

It's got me scared, scared of the unknown
Unknown numbers been blowing up my phone
I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someone's trying to take me out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
Can I fucking live?
[Chorus 2]
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm still in your head

[Post-Chorus]
I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head
I am your breaking point

[Bridge]
You can't run, you can't hide
I'll be there when you close your eyes at night
I'm always watching you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The doctor says I'm headed for destruction
My time is wearing thin...

[Chorus 2]
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm like a time bomb ticking in your head
Paranoia clouding your judgement
And no matter what you do about it, about it, about it
I'm still in your head4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""whine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""

I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I am entering)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will

Sleep tight
I hope I haunt your dreams still like you're haunting mine
Late night
And I just can't help but think that we're just wasting time

We had no direction like a candle's flame at the wind
Moving forward, back, don't know where to begin

A calm before the storm

Then I'm sorry that we met
I don't wanna pretend (I don't wanna pretend)

Nothing more and nothing less

Remind me of places and faces I used to lie
It's just not right

Time is up because the candle burned both ends
Just flying high but I feel I'm falling
It's in the eye of the storm

"[Verse]
There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing
Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known
I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France
And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could
Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Getting edgy all the time
Someone around me just a step behind
It's kind of scary, the shape I'm in
Walls are shaking and they're closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
Paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake

[Chorus]
Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kind of weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me

I tell you, something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends ’cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
Being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground

Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take

I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all

The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright

[Verse 2]
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

Check yes, Juliet, are you with me?
Rain is falling down on the sidewalk
I won't go until you come outside
Check yes, Juliet, kill the limbo
I'll keep tossing rocks at your window
There's no turning back for us tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Lace up your shoes (Ayo, ayo)
Here's how we do

[Chorus]
Run, baby run, don't ever look back
They'll tear us apart if you give them the chance (Give them the chance)
Don't sell your heart, don't say we're not meant to be
Run, baby run, forever we'll be
You and me

Check yes, Juliet, I'll be waiting
Wishing, wanting yours for the taking
Just sneak out and don't tell a soul goodbye
Check yes, Juliet, here's the countdown:
3, 2, 1, now fall in my arms now
They can change the locks, don't let them change your mind

The view from here is getting better with you by my side

"[Verse 1]
I feel the fire burning out
It's not worth saving
You've held me back, tied me down
Now I'm suffocating
I handed you a loaded gun
Dare you to take a shot
And after all that's said and done
Should’ve picked a fight you could’ve won

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't take much to get you on your knees
But you're never gonna get the best of me
I know what I want and it's everything you're not

[Chorus]
I know they call me crazy, cause I'm not changing
It's people like you, driving me insane
You're not sorry, that I'm not sorry
Sorry that you lost me
Now we're just strangers
(Now we're just strangers)

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, I'm stepping out
A risk worth taking
You never mind, can't hold me down
Are you sick of faking?
They handed you a loaded gun
One chance to take a shot
But now we're done

I know they call me crazy, cause I'm not changing
It's people like you, driving me insane
You're not sorry, that I'm not sorry
Sorry that you lost me

But you won't get my sympathy

"[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do
[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 3]
And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

[Chorus]
'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I can't let go of you

"[Verse 1]
I felt for sure last night that once we said goodbye
No one else will know these lonely dreams
No one else will know that part of me
I'm still driving away and I'm sorry every day
I won't always love these selfish things
I won't always live not stopping

[Verse 2]
It was my turn to decide
I knew this was our time
No one else will have me like you do
No one else will have me, only you

[Chorus]
You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time
What are you hoping for?
I'm here, I'm now, I'm ready
Holding on tight
Don't give away the end
The one thing that stays mine

[Verse 3]
Amazing still it seems
I'll be 23
I won't always love what I'll never have
I won't always live in my regrets

You'll sit alone forever if you wait for the right time

"[Verse 1]
Oh what a time to be alive!
Wake up and smell the dynamite
And keep your eyes locked tight to that screen
And don't believe everything that you see
And you'll find modern life's a catastrophe

[Chorus]
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls and dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
Oh, we almost had it
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
When the world went up in flames

[Verse 2]
We all worship celebrities, desperate for an identity
But cigarettes and MDMA don't give you substance
You don't think about what you say
'Cause your mouth is bigger than your brain
It's a shame, so fake and you’re all the same

[Chorus]
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls and dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
Oh, we almost had it
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
When the world went up in flames

There's a black cat in the windows of Parliament
There's a man in the back of a black cab, talking about the good days
When it all went up in flames (Happy judgement day)
It all went up in flames (Happy judgement day)
C'mon!

[Chorus]
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls and dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off

Never thought I'd see the day (No way!)

"[Verse 1]
To be alone together just once again
Is something that is sure to happen sometime
If my hands can't stay on the table
And if I find myself unable
To look away from staring in your eyes
And the color of the sunrise inside
I promise that I'll hold myself together
And act like this isn't killing me

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you once today
I painfully watched as you looked the other way
Afraid just to notice me standing there
You would make it obvious, you don't care

[Chorus]
I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak
I only love you for the give and the take
No, you know I want it

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with the thought of everything
I am lifted to a holy ground
And from up here can see a little of everything
And I can see you don't want me around
And I know how much that it makes you cringe
To think about you and I as friends
Together, forever, until the end
After that, you won't have to see me again
[Chorus]
I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak
I only love you for the give and the take
No, you know I want it
And when I die, just rip my heart out from my chest
And put it in a mason jar left to rest on your bedside table

[Bridge]
And if there's any hope alive after all
I would hold it like a newborn baby
And care for it like it was my own
Hey, you know, it looks kinda like me
And we'd still get chills every time we kiss
And I will always promise this, that to you I will never tell a lie
No, not to you
No, not to you

[Chorus]
I won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak
I only love you for the give and the take
No, you know I want it
And when I die, just rip my heart out from my chest
And put it in a mason jar left to rest on your bedside table

He listens to emo
But Fat Mike's his hero

A rail-slide, his knee tore
He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop
She left him for staring
At girls and not caring

Don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me

Should I let you fall, lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

Must be exhausting to lose your own game
Selfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late

So don't cry to me
If you loved me
You would be here with me

You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not

I've never seen this side of you
Another tragic case of feeling
Bruised and broken
From our head on collision
I've never seen this side of you
Another tragic case

[Verse 2]
And I'm still waiting for a good day
I think I've held this long enough
I think it's safe to tell you some things
It's not just what you say to people
And it's not the way you look at me
It's the way you present yourself
For all your worst critics to see
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Then you were gone
All this time you just didn't know it yet [x2]

Another tragic case of feeling
Bruised and broken
Another tragic case and I've been

Give it to me, baby!
Uh huh, uh huh!
And all the girlies say, I'm pretty fly for a white guy
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis

[Verse 1: Dexter]
You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

[Refrain: Dexter]
So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world needs wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing!

[Verse 2: Dexter]
He needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice
But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

[Refrain: Dexter]
So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake
The world loves wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing!

Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done
He asked for a 13 but they drew a 31
Friends say, he's tryin' too hard and he's not quite hip
But in his own mind, he's the, he's the dopest trip

I’m starting to wonder about my luck
When it’ll run out
Sooner or later
I’ll be hit by a bus any day now
Are your eyes blocked by cataracts
You can't see how good you have it
You’re taking a smile for granted

[Chorus]
You’re gonna wake up twenty years from now
Wishing you gave two shits about
All the lost moments you can never get back
You’d trade it for anything
Look back twenty years from now
Wondering why you cared about
Getting all the last words
Just to hear your own voice
But you weren’t saying anything

When all goes your way
Your thoughts dissolve to nothing
We learn to walk from falling
So I’ll kiss the curb

No longer I worry about a future I can’t figure out

I know I've got my problems and it starts with me
She saw something inside that I can't see
And late at night, yeah, she'll comfort me
Hold onto me, hold onto me

I got a nervous habit and I drink too much
She said she hates her life and wants to change her ways
She wakes in the night and whispers
Oh, so quiet

Hold onto me, hold onto me
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave
I know I've got my problems and it's probably me
So hold onto me, hold onto me

Stayed up too late and it hurts to breathe
Said it's 4 A.M., girl, go back to sleep
Sometimes at night, I can hear her dreams
Come rescue me, come rescue me
Don't you ever leave, don't you ever leave
I know we got our problems and it's probably me
So hold onto me, hold onto me

I'm a drifter's body in an open sea
And I've seen my reflection staring right back at me
With no place to go and you're left all alone

And my diamond ring's thrown out to sea
And when you love, do you love for me?

I still hope for the best
Say goodbye send me off with a kiss farewell
And I promise I'll be just as strong as I can be
Maybe you could get some sleep tonight

It's twisting me
I'd give anything to make you scream
And I'll just smile, and make believe I don't feel a thing
That doesn't work for me

Oh well, oh well
Guess I'll see you in hell
There's a pretty little picture that's in my head
And I'm starting to dream, changing colors while I sleep
Maybe I'm just wasting time

Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart
And it's not easy to talk about
So we all scream loud

[Verse 3]
And that was it
I had made it clean just across the street with my new wings
So I'll just fly and hope that I remember the good times when it's done

Oh well, oh well
I can't live with myself
As I'm climbing in your window to get to your bed
And I'll be what you need
You can call me anything
Just as long as we're still friends

Sit still and listen to the soundtrack
I'll tell you how I took one straight through the heart, and it's not easy to talk about
So we all sing

When she smiles well it's got nothing to do with me
I'm not the one who sings her to sleep
And I've been talking to God asking for just a little help with you but it's hopeless
It's not the first time but this one really carved it in
And tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again

Oh, Oh it's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that no one knows you like I do

She saw me for the first time in Columbus
But she was with her friends and I was in a tour bus
A few months later she was wearing my shirt in a photo shoot
I didn't even know that she was famous
How could someone so pretty be so dangerous?
She's only 5' tall but maybe 5'2"" in her wrestling boots

And I hear she can even sing
She's the champ of everything

(Hey!)
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?

She's got a finishing move called Twisted Bliss
And it's like my heart is caught in a sleeper hold
Woah-oh-oh
Why can't every girl be more like Alexa Bliss?

[Verse 2]
She says some really mean stuff to the other wrestlers
Some say they hate her but they just don't get her
And if you try to bring her down, she'll say ""Bless your heart""
Her favorite song's ""Girl All the Bad Guys Want""
Sometimes she cheats but she never gets caught, yeah
She's got a pig named Larry-Steve and he's so smart

I love to watch her in the ring
To me, she's the champ of everything

"Movement I

[Verse 1]
Time to tie myself down to the train track
Gonna relax and try to explain that I rarely feel alive unless I'm running for my life
'Cause I'm over monsters under the bed
But I've got suspicion in my head
That I've got the cure but I'm not so sure that I've got the cure
So when I hear that whistle blow (Ooh, ooh)
That's when I know it's time to go

[Chorus]
All I can do is run
All I can do is run
All I can do is run
Someone tell me where to
Someone tell me what from

Movement II

[Verse 1]
I can remember the days in my life
When my future looked bright
Back before mom had died
Before I heard dad coughing up blood in his room
And the doctor said ""Son, he'll be joining her soon""
And then everything changed
What was bright turned to bleak
'Cause everyone seemed to get sick, 'cept for me
And my dad's final cough, where they carted me off
They stuck me in hell and they gave me a cross

[Chorus]
And said ""Son, the church is all you've got now, got now, son
So give your life to God now, God
My son, I know you're scared, I know you're young
Just say your prayers tonight
'Cause nobody's gonna come
'Cause no one loves an orphan""

And almost every day I'm running 'round the block

Waking up next to nothing after dreaming of you and me

Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge
I'd drive straight off the edge

Taking your own life with boredom
I'm taking my own life with wine
It helps you to rule out the sorrow
It helps me to empty my mind

Leaving the coal calling the kettle black and orange and red
This kettle is seeing red.

[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be

[Verse 2]
What's the point of never making mistakes?
Self-indulgence, such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
Don't care, so why should I even pretend?

[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Situation never what you wanted
[Bridge]
Nothing's new (Everything's the same)
Keeps on dragging me down (It's getting kind of lame)
Falling further behind (There's nothing to explain)
No matter what you say, nothing's gonna change my mind

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this year's trend
And though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same, but who's to blame
For all those stupid things I never said?

[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, situation never what you want it to be

Never what you want it to be
Never what you want it to be2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
I never told you how I felt
Though I thought I'd said it all
And I never knew you needed help
Well, 'cause you always seemed so tough
But now I'm here alone
Without you by my side
If only I had known
That you kept it all inside
Now I'm trying to understand
Just trying to find a way
But forgive you, I just can't
It's all just too much for me to take

[Chorus]
And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
But now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
And all I want's another chance, I can't accept that you have left

[Verse 2]
Look at all this damage done
Are you happy with yourself?
And we thought the best was yet to come
And, and I thought I knew you oh so well
And the days just go by
While the moment seems to last
Like catching fire
All is gone, and it all went up so fast
[Chorus]
And if I failed you, well, I swear I tried my best
And now you're gone, so all your tears can lay to rest
Just so you know
You meant the world to us, I know that it's too late
And all I want's another chance, I can't accept that you have left
That you have left

I don't even know which way it oughta go
Get out before you drown, before they bring us down

And I'm not your only fun

You like to lose control and I take it
I turn the music up so it drowns us out, oh

Shattered over what I've just done

"Hey Sweet Annie
Don't take it so bad
You know the summer's coming soon
Though the interstate is choking under salt and dirty sand
And it seems the sun is hiding from the moon

Your daddy told you
When you were a girl
The kind of things that come to those who wait
So give it a rest girl
Take a deep breath girl
And meet me at the Baystate tonight
And the snow is coming down
On our New England town
And it's been falling all day long
What else is new?
What could I do?
I wrote a valley winter song
To play for you

And late December
Can drag a man down
You feel it deep in your gut
Short days and afternoons spent pottering around
In a dark house with the windows painted shut
Remember New York
Staring outside
As reckless winter made its way
From Staten Island to the Upper West Side
Whiting out our streets along the way

And the snow is coming down
On our New England town
And it's been falling all day long
What else is new?
What can I do?
But sing this valley winter song
I wrote for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

(K-- In the-- And I'm drunk, too)

(Uh oh oh oh...)
Baby, for years you've been saying
""Why don't you write me a song?""
And I'm like
""I don't know, because I'm not inspired to write you a song!""
But last night I decided
I'm gonna freaking do this!

[Verse 1]
We've been together for so long
And you always asked me why I never wrote a song
All about you and about our love
And about how you're the only one I'm thinking of

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been writing all night
And I got it just right
Here we go!

[Chorus]
You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!
[Verse 2]
And all my homies
Have always said
""What you doing with that girl?
She's fucked up in the head!""
My mom don't like you
My dad don't too
And my brother says you look like
The guy from Hüsker Dü

I'm just keeping it real
This is just how I feel

You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!

Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!
I promised you forever
But we both know
We're never gonna get along
You want it?
You got it!
Here's your freaking song!

I get drunk and you get pissed!
You start dreaming I don't exist!
I say yes and you say no!
Just like Katy Perry says, you're Hot and Cold!
With all the shit that we've been through!
This is the best that I can do!
Can I still get lucky tonight?

These are manners and everything
I, uh, I-I hope you like this song
I spent a lot of time on it
But I didn't spend--
Oh, there's Erik
Just playing, I didn't spend a lot of time on this
But this is the Chorus

You talk too much!
You never shut up!
Everything I do for you is never enough!
You snore, you drool
You talk in your sleep!
Won't get a night's rest until you're Six Feet Deep!

3 Minutes long it's still going here...
I don't even know what's happening
(You want it? You got it!)
Anyway, that's the song that I wrote for you it's, it's okay
Evidently its over now, I don't know
I have no idea on the timing of it or anything
And I... uh...
Boy this is sort of an awkward moment here...

Untie the balloons from around my neck
And ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me, I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone

And my ego's in a sling

"None of the people I know seem to be sleeping well at night
Everyone's diagnosed with some kind of nervousness or fright
Where did the peaceful dreams of our childhood go?
None of the people I know seem to be living their own lives
Everyone's under control, trapped in a cubicle to die
Where did the glory dreams of our childhood go?
You know you sound crazy when you're screaming til you're bleedin'
And it may sound like its not true, I've done that to believe it
And if you should need it
If you need a friend, don't be afraid to call me up again
Up again, up again, up again, up again
Part of the gardner estate, was a concert made of paint
Ours to behold we were told, ten million times it weight in gold
Out her museum one night concert did go
I had a painting I loved, red graffiti on black gloss
It was lost in the travels we made, back in our homes we should have stayed
Up on the internet auctioning block it did go
I know it sounds crazy, but these colours make our feelings
When these things are stolen, it is worse than crime, it's killing
And if God is willing
When you need a friend, you won't have anyone to call you up again
Up again, up again, up again. up again
It's the middle of the night, and everythings alright
I'll go to bed alone again
Yeah everythings alright, but the dim street light, is flooding in the room again
And empty spaces that are next to me are a little freer than I care to be
It's still the middle of the night, yeah everythings alright
I'll go to bed alone again
It's free, a little freerer than I care to be

[Bridge]
And if you sing to me sweet until then
I may never sail Virginia again
And as this current moves slow for me
This much you must know: we'll meet again
And El, I'll have you know I'm scared to death
Tell me once again
That you'll love me to the death
And should I die, you swear that you will come for me
As I fade away, you reach out your hand

(And please don't let me go)
And please don't let me go
(And please don't let me go)
And please don't let me go

[Chorus]
And I'll be here by the ocean
Just waiting for proof that there's sunsets and silhouette dreams
All my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes
And every wave drags me to sea
I could stand here for hours
Just to ask God the question, ""Is everyone here make-believe?""
With a tear in His voice, He says, ""Son, that's the question.""
Does this deafening silence mean nothing to no one but me?6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I heard about the bad news today
A crowd of people around you
Telling you it's okay
And everything happens for a reason

When you lose a part of yourself
To somebody you know
It takes a lot to let go
Every breath that you remember
Pictures fade away but memory is forever

An empty chair at all the tables
And I'll be seeing you when all my days boil down
But it's better where you're going anyway

Tough times and long days

Waiting for the phone to ring
It's getting lonely living upside down

Going out of my head, alone in this bed

You spend your days counting the hours you're awake
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
As the light turns off inside your heart can you remember
What it's like to care?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
With the memories that haunt us, I cherish just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grave
Yet I fall through these clouds and she's screaming

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free

This grip loosens but it never breaks
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall
And now I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass
Until forever, until forever ends
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime

Dull heat rises from the sheets

I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain

Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...

Talking to each other again? (Uh)

Hey, man, you know I'm really okay
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
’Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off, it makes me insane
I open the glove box, reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

Of blowin' away (Yeah, Yeah)

And it ain't goin' away (Yeah, Yeah)

If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
If you drive on my ass, your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last

He grew up three blocks away
The same old neighborhood
Spends too much time on his lawn
When there's no football on
Where did the time go?
What's that on his face?
Always thought we'd live forever
I don't think we're up for that
(Get to bed by 9 p.m.)

[Chorus]
We used to run wild in the streets
Now we complain when cars drive too fast
And the music is insanely loud
Now our tattoos are fading away
And looking back, it was all worth it
The truth is: getting old sucks, but everybody's doing it

[Verse 2]
We worked at all the same jobs
We chased the same girls
We played in all the same bands
Each other's best-est man
You had a heart attack
I've got two bum knees
We don't wanna live forever
What the fuck is TikTok?
(Golf checkers, bingo, dominoes)

We used to run wild in the streets
Now we complain when cars drive too fast
And the music is insanely loud
Now our memories are fading away
And looking back, it was all worth it

Alright, I don't think we can do bridges anymore
We need a break

Now we complain when cars drive too fast
And the music is insanely loud
Now the movies are cartoons and remakes of shit

It's a new day, but it all feels old
""It's a good life!"" That's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

[Pre-Chorus]
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Verse 2]
""Go to college or university
Get a real job!"" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna

What's wrong baby?
Don't they treat you like they should?
Did you take them for it?
For every penny that you could?
We once walked out on the beach and once I almost touched your hand
Oh how I dreamed to finally say such things
Then only to pretend

[Verse 2]
Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you (don't you know that I miss you?)
Ninth and Ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you: your whisper, your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

If you don't, don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?

'Cause I need this now more than I ever did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't

I left you waiting (I know I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?
On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Someday maybe
Maybe someday we'll be smarter
And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get and
Took everything you let me have
And then I never loved you back

It's time to kick the habit, I'm coming clean
It's been a hell of a ride but it's all caught up with me
And now I'm off track
Feel like I'm right back where I started
Sat on the kitchen floor all alone talking to a ghost
About where we go when we go
He said, ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run and…

Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh my friend, just look how far you've come
And think twice before you go and throw it all away

[Verse 2]
Between the peace and the panic
I can't break up the static
I need a cleaner frequency
I frequently burn out and vanish
I'm on another planet
There's just no getting through to me
But then I find myself in bed
Lost inside my head again
Running over everything
The voices, they are deafening
Out from the noise
I hear that familiar voice
He says ""Life is the great unknown""
Better jump, better run, better go
Better jump, run

Maybe I'm a fucking waste
Filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on the last paycheck
I'm the cliché in a song
And everybody's singing along
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sinking, you're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

Someone please come pull me out
From the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up, I'm falling

Oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town

I wrote the words to this song on the back of a photograph
Behind your back it goes
A little something like this is way too big to miss
I got a letter in the mail
The sender failed to let me know where it came from
Opened it up and sure enough, there we were, arm in arm again

[Verse 2]
I know it's small but my last call's been called, half an hour ago
I know it's late but do you think you could at least fix it for me?
Then I'll go, I'll go alone
I swear I won't tell a soul
I'll drink this beer and write in fear of a song everybody hates

Armageddon, let the light in
Before we say goodbye, give us something to believe in
Armageddon, we're not begging
For too much, I don't think
Need a goodbye kiss before we sink

[Verse 1]
Always see it on T.V.​
Or read in the magazines
Celebrities who want sympathy
All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
I don't think they would survive
If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

[Chorus]
Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

[Verse 2]
Well, did you know if you were famous you could
Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran
And did you know if you were caught and you were
Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to see them spend a week living life out on the street

This is the age of descent
The fresh faced generation of defect
It's gotta come down before we reach for the reset
This is for the lost, downtrodden and rejects
And anybody looking for a purpose
We all kick our way through streets of grey
Some find hope in a TV screen
But nobody has an answer for anything
And no one can seem to agree

And then the 8 Ball said ""things don't look great""
You know we can't break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we'll see who is standing in the wasteland

It's just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
To tell the truth I never listen, just grit my teeth and split
It's just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
But no one ever fucking listens
Yeah no one ever fucking listens
So you can take your damn opinion and fucking suck it

Accidents out on the highway to somewhere
They tell us about when we're young
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes
Before she can see what they've done
Nobody told her she'd lose in the first round
The last fight was fixed from the start
Names on her sidewalks, they move through her body
Like razors, they cut through her heart
Like razors, they cut through her heart

Hey, let go of all you know
And you're flying away now
What have you got to lose?
And say out loud these words I've found

Night life, the high life, she just wants a good life
So someone remembers her too
But somewhere she heard there was some place to go
When you die, when you live like we do
Die when you live like we do

It’s been 28 days since I’ve seen the sunshine
'Cause I just can't seem to lift this cloud away
I swear all the tears I’ve cried could fill an ocean
I've been swimming in a sea of misery

I can't find the strength to leave this bed

But I’m through, I'm done, I've had enough

Call me out, you stayed inside
The one you love is where you hide
Shot me down, as I flew by
Crash and burn, I think sometimes
You forget where the heart is

Answer ""no"" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say ""it's okay""

How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?

It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down

And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend

You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You'd never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

I hope you get your ballroom floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember

I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor

Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could've been

This is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

In the end, it's all a question of heart

Hey, where have you gone?
You used to be the one that we looked up to
It seemed like nothing could break you down
How high was your price and was it worth it?

Nothing in life is a sure bet anyway, you're gone
I guess you weren't here from the start
In the end, it's all a question of heart

Hey, where did it go?
Everything we fought for and everything it meant
Maybe we were just naive, but I still believe
There are only a few things that really belong to me

Who I am, who I was
And who I want to be
Hey, where have I gone?
I used to be the one looking for the hero in some far off place
Blindly ever forward, never knowing all along
The truth was right there in my own songEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

"[Spoken Intro: Aaron Weiss]
Found these old letters from years ago
Felt it was fitting to continue that correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today, I hope this is helpful for you
I also hope that Birdie is happy and healthy and staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way of finally being able to address how it feels to have [...]
[Verse: Aaron Weiss]
Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray
Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance
Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me

When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again
I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me
So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

[Outro: Aaron Weiss]
I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself
And I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story
Who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
And jumped in and grabbed the coat
The river was rushing toward a waterfall
And, and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I wish that I could die

All your little shameful looks were buried in my heart like hooks
I didn't wanna be here, you told me I was evil
And when I finally ran away, just trying to escape that pain
I wanted to believe I belonged somewhere on my own

Is finding a good way to spend it

Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey!)
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)

Fit so well into your plans

Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled times

Pining away
Every hour in your room
Rolling with the motion
Waiting 'til it's opportune
Sitting there
Watching time fly past you
Why do tomorrow
What you could never do?
How she loved you
All you imagined
All the shit you put her through

Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled times

And it takes a lot of nerve
To ask how she is doing
Start with a weak foundation
You will end in ruins
The way the days and hours pass
You'll never understand
Falling like rain through your hands

Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled times
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled timesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

"[Verse 1]
Hmmmm...
I found out in the fall, I've been gone
On the road for a year
She said, ""Honey, I've got real bad news""
And then there were just tears
And we would never be the same again
Since then I've often wondered
What you might have been like
How it would have felt to hold you
Would you have had my eyes?
Don't you think we would've been best friends?

[Chorus 1]
You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

[Verse 2]
We were twenty-two years young then
Breaking rules all around
We were moving in that first apartment
It felt like it was never gonna end
Both so lost and crazy
We were young so we ran
Now I live in a dream where I am
Holding your little hands
I never got to meet you, my best friend
[Chorus 2]
You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
And you would have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

[Bridge]
Don't you think we would have been best friends?

[Chorus 3]
You would be ten and I'd be
Driving you to school
You would tell all your friends
That you thought I was cool
You would be out in the sun
Until it was gone
You would be watching Star Wars
With your PJs on
You would be playing tunes on
On your first guitar
You would be harmony to
Every single part of me
And you have
All the love in my heart
Yeah, you would have
All the love in my heart

That you live with no regrets

To listen to the beating in your mind

(Hip hip hooray for the elephants on parade)

[Verse 1]
Take the gist of it and twist it
'Til it makes you smile
And don't be scared if there's a snare
Sometimes it takes a while
There's much to learn from every turn inside a labyrinth
Don't you try to think about it
No way to talk about it
And I will ever change and never cease to be amazed
Air bubbles up and overflows and then it goes away
I want to hold and nurture every second of this life that has been given to me
Even though limitedly

Hip hooray for the elephants on parade

[Verse 2]
You're preaching to the chorus
Line alright for this whole time
And I'm fine if I can
Tell a lie about the minor crimes
I won't try to justify the reason why
I think that I'll never die is so preposterous
It's like a bag of circus peanuts in a sewage drain
Or airin' out your dirty laundry on a weather vane

I got the feeling that I wanna be alone with you
And I got the feeling that you
Might want to be alone with me too
Take a finger and snap, just like that
And I had to say hey baby let's go
And make it home for our show
Simple defragmentation gets us to the point at last
But no relaxing 'til they give us all our memory back
Touché but they had the wherewithal to take it all out of order anyway
They can always make you pay up
And I will ever change and never cease to be amazed

I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind
Well, she's got baggage and it's of the emotional kind
She talks about closure and that validation bit
I don't mean to be insensitive, but I really hate that shit

[Chorus 1]
And I say yeah, yeah
Oh man, she's got issues and I'm going to pay
Yeah, yeah
She thinks she's the victim, yeah

Now I know she'll feel abandoned
If I don't stay over late
And I know she's afraid to commit
But it's only our second date

Oh man, she's got issues and I'm going to pay
Yeah, yeah
She thinks she's the victim but she takes it all out on me

I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favor
And check your baggage at the door
[Verse 3]
Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind
But when she calls out his name in bed, that's where I draw the line
You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone
But I wish you wouldn't call me 'daddy' when we're gettin' it on

[Chorus 1]
And I say yeah, yeah
Oh man, she's got issues and I'm going to pay

Cut the music up

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

"I’ve been known a thousand ways
Choked a hundred hearts in half as many days

And I get so lost inside this city
You ugly girls all look so pretty
It’s true
What am I supposed to do?

I still got you waiting
Look out your window
What do you see?
You don’t see me

You’re a pretty little flower
I’m a busy little bee
Honey, that’s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
But then I’m gonna leave
Honey I know you’ll wait for me

You’re all alone but you understand
That we’re too young to start making plans agreeing
Monogamy’s not a part of me
And I know my line and is just a sin
But I swear to you I’m gonna do it again
I’m not making any friends
I just wanted you to wait
There out your window
What do you see?
You don’t see me

Cause you’re a pretty little flower
But I’m a busy little bee
Honey, that’s all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Baby then I’m gonna leave
Honey I know you’ll wait for me

Pulled out your picture the other day
(Oh isn’t that sweet)
You didn’t have that much to say
(Cause it wasn't even me)
Cause I know that you said
I’m better off on my own and I’m better off dead

I just want you there to wait
Look out your window
What do you see?
You don’t see me

Come on, come on, come on

We don't belong here

In a way, we are all connected
Threaded together
In a way, we are all suspended
Bound going nowhere

Wake up
Walk on the wires
Defeat and define
Wake up
Evolve and escape
Unravel, unmake yourself

[Chorus]
We speak in tongues
And we walk on the wires between
(We don't belong here)
We are the sleeping sickness
The dancing dreams
(We don't belong here)
We're invaders from the inside
We're survivors in silver skin
Shapeless, we move
Unwinding the wires between
(We don't belong here)
[Verse 2]
So we'll follow, follow down
Each knotless fathom to the end
No more hollow, hollow sounds
Of echoes, echoes in our heads

Wake up
Walk on the wires
Connect and combine
Wake up
React and reshape
Untangle, unmake yourself

We speak in tongues
And we walk on the wires between
(We don't belong here)
We are the sleeping sickness
The dancing dreams
(We don't belong here)

Shapeless, we move
Unwinding the wires between
(We don't belong here)

And we're still learning how to survive
Will you walk with me a while
And see a world with brand new eyes?
We see the sights
And we're fighting for our lives
Will you run?
Will you run?
Will you run?

Forever haunted, more than afraid
Asphyxiate on words I would say
I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue

There are no flowers, no, not this time
There'll be no angels gracing the lines

Just how much this hurts me

"I remember when I was told of story of
Crushed velvet, candle wax, and dried up flowers
The figure on the bed all dressed up in roses, calling
Beckoning to sleep, offering a dream

Words were as mystical as purring animals
The circle of rage, the ghosts on the stage appeared
The time was so tangible, I'll never let it go
Ghost stories handed down reached secret tunnels below
No one could see me

I fell into yesterday
Our dreams seemed not far away
I want to, I want to, I want to stay
I fell into fantasy

I want to, I want to, I want to stay

And she was always smiling
The teenage death boys, the teenage death girls
And everyone was dancing
Nothing could touch us then, no one could change us then
Everyone was dancing
Nothing could hurt us then, no one could see us then
Everyone was dancing

To everyone who's ever been called a freak (y'all know what I'm saying)

Like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
And the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five!)
Like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (you still suck!)
Like the time that girl broke up with me cause I wasn't cool enough, trick!

Things, things, here we go!

The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down

You want to hate me now
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you kids later...)
We checked his room, his things were gone, we didn't see him no more, dick!

"I put that record on just to make a sound
The rhythm hit, it got my movement off the ground
Soundtrack of what I want to be
If I want to change the world, it's gotta start with me

I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again

And in the end what have we learned?
Are we just faces in the crowd?
I died and was reborn again today
Hold fast to myself, make these good feelings stay

We laughed, we cried
The music shaped our lives
So tell me why our movement's out of time?
Are we so out of line?

I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again
I put the needle on the record
I put the needle on the record and play that song again

A movement with no leaders
We stand tonight, hearts in our handsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Verse 1]
She's going out to forget they were together
All that time he was taking her for granted
She wants to see, if there's more
Than he gave, she's looking for
He calls her up, he's trippin' on the phone now
He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's movin' it, knows she's using it
Now he's losing it, she don't care

[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
[Verse 2]
He was always giving her attention
Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
That girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him
She calls him up; she's trippin' on the phone now
He had to get out and he ain't comin' home now
He's trying to forget her; that's how he got with her
When he first met her, when they first got together
[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""

[Bridge]
To the beat
To the beat
To the beat
You got nothing to lose
Don't be afraid to get down
[Verse 3]
We break up, it's something that we do now
Everyone has got to do it sometime
It's okay, let it go
Get out there and find someone
It's too late to be trippin' on the phone here
Get off the wire you know everything is good here
Stop what you're doing, you don't wanna ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one
[Chorus]
Everybody, put up your hands
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feel the beat now, if you've got nothing left
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Back it up now, you've got a reason to live
Say, ""I don't wanna be in love, I don't wanna be in love""
Feelin' good now, don't be afraid to get down

Warn your warmth to turn away
Here, it's December every day (I like that)
Press your lips to the sculptures
And surely, you'll stay (love like winter)
For of sugar and ice
I am made, I am made

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
(Por siempre)
She said, ""It seems you're somewhere far away,"" to his face

"[Verse 1]
I'm just so tired
Won't you sing me to sleep?
And fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride with you tonight
And get away from this place
Get a new name and face
I just ain't the same without you in my life

[Verse 2]
Late night drives
All alone in my car
I can't help but start
Singing lines from all our favorite songs
And melodies in the air
Singing ""Life just ain't fair""
Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone

[Chorus]
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

[Verse 3]
Feel your fire
When it's cold in my heart
And things sorta start
Reminding me of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
""I wish that I had gone up with you too""
[Chorus]
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

I hope that all is well in heaven
Cause it's all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
Cause I'm so lost without you down here

I was living day-to-day
As the meetings, they would suggest
Sitting pretty, having one foot out that door
No, I didn't know how to act
Started runnin' and I didn't look back

Still don't know where I'm goin'
Oh, and then you let me in
Don't know how you did it other than you did

Cut your wrist and come and get you some

"[Intro]
Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Bang bang go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, then gone forever
It seems like just yesterday
How did I miss the red flags raised?
Think back to the days we laughed
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees he cried
But on his feet he died
What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?
[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah

[Verse 2]
Bang bang from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand
From the nation under God
I feel its love like a cattle prod
Born free but still, they hate
Born me, no I can't change
It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong
[Chorus]
Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing
Woah, woah


[Verse 3]
The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues
And too much blood has flown from the wrists
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood?
We're calling for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah
A brand new song

Billy Lucas, age 15
Harrison Chase Brown, age 15

This life chose me, I’m not lost in sin
But proud I stand of who I am
I plan to go on living

I don't stand a chance
Against the glow of answers
Lighting up your face across the pillow landscape
The list of things
I feel is crazy
News to me that I would need a second wake up

It's all been happening
Like they said it might
Am I weak if I want to fight?

What makes our love so hard to be?
Is it you? Or is that you with me?
For just the possibility
I'd have given anything
We play along, we sell
But only so much we can tell ourselves
Is it you? Or is it that you with me?
You with me

Pull like magnets
Cloud of static
The air between is punishing, but nothing happens

And it's sad to think of
Expecting different outcomes with a better question

I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around like she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that girl I adored
Don't seem to know, don't seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore

There's nothing where she used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's right, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

[Verse 2]
So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now

I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need four more hoes, we need oh, oh, oh, oh!

We balling too serious, and you out of bounds

And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor

I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mother-fudge cake; now, tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake—soo-woo!
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it—remix!

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
​iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that ""I think I'm late"" text

Is it typical for us to end like this?
Am I just another scene from a movie that you've seen
One hundred times?
Cause baby you weren't the first or the last or the worst
And I've got to fill the blanks in the past with a verse
And we could sit around and cry but frankly
You're not worth it anymore

So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry, and I...
On any other day I'd shoot the boy
But your simple toy had caused a scene like this
Leave him hanging on the walls, just a picture in the hall
Like a hundred more (like a hundred more)
Consider this as a gift as you taste him on your lips
And he's making you scream with his hands on your hips
I hope he's leaving you empty baby this is just a fix
Such a simple little whore

If you open your eyes
See through the lies
You're losing more than just a friend

Shattered glass we've come undone

She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said ""What?"" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, gonna sneak in through her window

Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait 'til her parents go out of town

You gotta keep 'em separated

Like the latest fashion
Like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Gettin' weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out their own campus locale
And if they catch you slippin', then it's all over, pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up...

Hey! Come out and play

By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never-ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own...

Where everything's nothing without you
I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile

Through it all, I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

Thoughts ran unspoken, forever in vow
And pieces of memories fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have, so I won't let this go

All the streets where I walked alone
With nowhere to go have come to an end

Extracting information from my mind
The photographs she take save to a mainframe

Stark and dark against enemy skies
From miles above the earth no one can detect her

"I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days and glory never fades
Never fades, fades away

After years and miles, my broken feet
Walk back to you up this broken street
I guess the years went by, but the years just made you shine
And never fade, fade away

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold

I saw you from across the street today
My heart skipped a beat today
Reminding me of those lost days
And glory never fades

Years passed by and you remind me
Those things will always find me
Young hearts are made of gold that never fades away
Never fades, fades away

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold
As the years pass by
A young heart beats inside
These dreams of yours and mine that time can't take away
Take away, take away

I heard someone say
That nothing gold can stay
But there's a love in all our souls
And it shines like gold

And if I'm worth the pressure
Check myself and pull it all together
Pull it all together
Pull it all together
Pull it all together

Tell me why I feel this way
The colour drained from my brain
Get it straight and put my head together

"This time I'm on to you
You should know this time it's personal, I'm
Not immune to your disease and you've found
A thousand ways to make me bleed
And so I start again
And think of me however you like
You brought me to my knees it's alright
I need a reason to believe
Until then I'll carry the sorrow
We've been living here on borrowed time
Never knowing if it's all that's at stake
Draw the battle lines and wait till you break
You'll always be a part of me
If I can't find a way
If I can't change the locks in your heart
There's nothing more to say it's all gone
I need a reason to believe
Until then I'll carry the sorrow
And I'll make it a part of myself
We've been living here on borrowed time
Never knowing if it's all that's at stake
Draw the battle lines and wait till you break
You'll always be a part of me
There was a way you could've changed my mind
That was yesterday and yesterday's gone
Where does love go when it's all gone wrong
You'll always be a part of me
What you say, what you do
I don't believe
Cut me open, watch me bleed
What you say, what you do
I don't believe
Cause you're lying through your teeth
This time I'm on to you
You should know this time it's personal
We've been living here on borrowed time
Never knowing if it's all that's at stake
Draw the battle lines and wait till you break
You'll always be a part of me
There was a way you could've changed my mind

Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell

She's ripping wings off of butterflies

You are the brightest I’ve seen, you are the best side of me
And just for when we’re apart I’ve got a piece of your heart

But I want the whole damn thing

I feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too

Could never sever through, not what we have me and you
Burning together and burning forever

And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

[Chorus 2]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
She likes 'em with a mustache
Racetrack season pass
Drivin' in a Trans-Am
Does a mullet make a man?
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Bridge]
There she goes again
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked!
[Chorus 3]
Now I'm watchin' wrestling
Tryna be a tough guy
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (Moped, moped)
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want

'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

With shooters that shoot through the iron, man, and see through the con man and now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Watch for the spy cam, sit back and watch, and do not watch your watch hand, give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man, I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock, but it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land

Things have been getting pretty rough around here
No coffee cups flying 'round the room
Just daggers born from tears
Let’s try to crawl out from under our breath
We can never break up, so I love you to death
The man I'd become was so comfortably dumb
I believe you could mean it, but you’re not having fun
And I’m sorry

[Verse 2]
I learned to breathe I guess some time ago
But just recently I learned what it means to take it slow
I’m lousy with excuses and you know I love to swear
So goddamnit, I swear to whatever’s out there
And I love you more now than I ever have, so

[Chorus]
Let’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let’s find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too
You might leave me still, but not today
For now, can we just stay?
Can we just stay?
[Verse 3]
You would think by now that I’d be fine
Y'know, like really stretching out
But it would all be lies
I'm no longer in control of my own shoes
There they go
Quickly running out of booze
Drinking to kill myself to live without you
Over there, where I’m still scared
Sometimes

[Chorus]
Let’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away
Let’s find some other time to break down
The storm has gone and blown on through
Shake off the darkness, and I will too
You might leave me still, but not today

The fan blades on the ceiling spin but the air is never cold
And even though you are next to me I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything for you to call your own

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking like a weight

[Verse 2]
Something I've been keeping locked away behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free with each and every kiss
I couldn't bear to hurt you but it's all so different now
Things that I was sure of, they have filled me up with doubt

And I can feel you breathing

Left to be unwritten like memories to unfold
And I don't believe the truth, it doesn't make me feel alive
The truth's just overrated, we've all got something to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause lies make it so much fun
So sing the praise of insincerity
Make this your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head
Just another crying shame, life is such a deadly game
Gone wrong, fire at will, put a bullet in his head

[Verse 2]
Pay me no more mind, have I really come undone?
I left the world this evening just to kill the sun
And I've got no more to bleed, all that's left will soon be gone
Especially before my mind fades like the stars at dawn
[Pre-Chorus]
Well I bet you got a lot to say
So have it your way and crucify me
Make this your your last prayer
As the dream becomes your worst nightmare

I'm not your savior or a saint, no use praying for escape
I'll be there just to put the bullet in your head

Breathless kiss to end all this, I fall, I say goodbye to all
Close my eyes, oh, sweet demise, a love that no one understands

And no one will be spared
There's 32 ways you can die here tonight

The ocean floor explodes, eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate a burning lullaby

Her words pierce the dark night, ""does anyone care?""

In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction
I wrapped a hand around its stem
I pulled until the roots gave in
Finding there what I'd been missing

But I know...
So I tell myself, I tell myself it's wrong
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

[Hook]
All because of you
I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice
All you have to do is shout it out

[Verse 2]
Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up, fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now
I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live. I walked away now
But I know...
Not a day goes by that I don't feel this burn
There's a point we pass from which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

I haven't slept in so long

All because of you

When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
Inside these arms of yours

All because of you

Not the kind with wings
No, not the kind with halos
The kind that bring you home
When home becomes a strange place

No girls, no sweet romance

Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)

You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"" and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you,"" she gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself
[Outro: Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar]
She say, ""Ooh, Daddy, ooh,"" Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" no emotion (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Always preparing for another storm

Today is the day I will die

I wrote a letter, I said I'd miss her

We took a drive and we drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations, we talked of old friends

It bums me out and makes me wonder why I can't do right
And I'm trying my best, I promise
And I want this as long as you want it

I need some time just deliver the things that I need for now
Everything that I feel's like a warm deep calm casting over me
And it's taking me to somewhere new
If you believe that everything's alright
You won't be all alone tonight
And I'd be blessed by the light of your company
Slowly lifting me to somewhere new

[Chorus]
Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well
Since the last time that we spoke, you said
""Please understand if I see you again don't even say hello.""

Please

What a night it is, when you live like this
And you're coming up beneath the clouds
Don't let me down
All the love's still there I just don't know what to do with it now
You know, I still can't believe we both did some things
I don't even wanna think about
Just say you love me and I'll say ""I'm sorry
I don't want anybody else to feel this way""
No, no, no

Oh can you tell, I haven't slept very well
Since the last time that we spoke, I said
""Please understand I've been drinking again, and all I do is hope""

I'll admit I was wrong about everything
Cause I'm high and I don't wanna come down
All the fun that we had on your mothers couch

What was I supposed to do
You know I love you

"[Verse 1]
Let's start it here
Back in nineteen-seventy-sumthin'
I can't pin down the year
When the romance wasn't dead
And love still stood for something
There was a girl who'd lost her way
She blushed red when he came over
And they danced the night away
And he sung as he drove her home and
It was there that she would say
""If I could, then I would save you""
And he smiled and turned away
In six weeks they're saying ""I do""
Oh, love just don't go that way no more

[Chorus]
And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all
[Verse 2]
And now it's nineteen-ninety-sumthin'
How the hell did we end up here?
Four kids and a few jobs later
And the pictures fill the pages
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But you'd be a fool to give it up
'Cause you know that what we've got is bigger than the two of us
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But it's bigger than the two of us
And I will hold you in my arms
When you feel like giving up
Love just don't go that way no more

[Chorus]
And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And I just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all

[Verse 3]
And now its two-thousand-and-sumthin'
We made it here my dear
Grandkids and the mortgage paid off
Is this what dreams are made of?
'Cause baby we made it
Yeah baby, you saved me
But nothing could save him
From the ambulance that day
When he went away
The heart attack was sharp
He didn't feel no pain
If you saw him now then what
What would you say?
I love you and I miss you
I owe you everything
And I hope you know you saved me (Saved me!)
[Verse 4]
Oh mother
Mother please don't cry
'Cause you know I miss him too
I didn't even say goodbye
And though he's gone, I know he's gone
He lives on in all of us
And I will hold you when you cry
'Cause that's what he would've done (Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done (Oh mother!)
Yeah, that's what he would've done
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But he's a part of all of us
And we will hold you when you cry
'Cause that's what family does10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Is there anybody out there?
That wakes up with a bitter taste?
It's a king that we put up there
And he's a short way to fall from grace
It's slowly filling upward
You can stand but you have no ground
I hear it from the lost words
They say it's time that you lost your crown

Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you
When hearts are beating
Say what you want 'em to do
Wasting away, I see you

Finding a day, don't wanna be you
When the top of the world falls on you

Is there anybody out there?
That can see what a man can change?
It's better that you don't care
Because he knows that he's in his stage
I feel the paranoia
When there's a time, put you in your place
In the eyes of those who watch ya
Well they can wait 'til you hit your face

Don't be so greedy
A dollar's a penny to you

And you win, and you win, and you win
Paint yourself a picture

Move along, move along like I know ya do

I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself

Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell and I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration, huh!

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will (We will!)
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

I'm far away but I am right there
If distance only makes you stronger
Don't make it last any longer

I hope this doesn't last forever

Yo, should I be a star? Baby, I think I already are
Not a saint, not that great, feel like I was born a car
In '94, the world started me and I've been driving
Sometimes a man just can't open his car, and
Ain't gotta be somebody, be anybody
Rather be anybody than live in a dead body
If you can't see me then find a helicopter
In the night sky, shine like a star

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
And I'm back with a madness
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside
I got nothing but dreams

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in

Have you ever felt how hard it is to be an anybody
To be living, to be breathing, not choosing a dead body
Remember, the man told me that this life is a party
Yeah, all the glory's so short you should put away the garbages
Normal ain't normal, ordinary is a luxury
People say ""Woo, pessimism"" what the other mean?
If you wanna understand, you stand under
This shit is vital, respect to the mothers and fathers
What's wrong with the life of a passenger
If somebody gotta be, then I'mma be the messenger
I'm just too young, don't know what to believe in
But too young, you know, not to be living
I will stay, I will wait and I'll fight like a king
Even though I can forever ever be a king
I will marry this goddamn world, by my own
And put myself on a goddamn ring

Going out, we hope to lose ourselves
Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all you need
To end up empty
Who really says they hope they'll meet the one
For the first time at a bar drinking early?
Easy enough to say ""Hey man, I'm done""
And never hear them say

Oh, honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?

And no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho

We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often, how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something

Born on a lonely planet full of broken dreams
Where no one understands me
When I finally met an angel, I didn't know what to say
She just held my hand
And we would lay awake at night, looking at the stars
Thinking of the ones we've lost, and wonder where they are
When we lit another candle, she asked me who's to blame
Then she put her arms around me and held me to the flame

So why do we hurt each other?
We don't need the words for one another's

Don't ask me why
(please don't cry)
I can't tell you lies..

Angels cry
When stars collide
I can't eat
And I can't breathe
I wouldn't want it any other way
(repeat)
My heart, burns through
My chest, to the floor
Tearing me silently although abruptly; words can't hide as I'm taking you home, and I tried to see
Tried to understand your words as I'm taking you home

Angels cry
When stars collide
I can't eat
And I can't breathe
I wouldn't want it any other way
Angels cry

If it means to be away from you, then that's okay with me

The sun doesn't rise or set, it doesn't mean a thing
Because there's no end today, just pillows and sheets

I wanna know if I'm tracing over
All your scars help with your closure
I wanna know all your plans and dreams
And why your dreams mean more

[Chorus]
I got another half of me miles away
And now I'm longing something I can't feel
At times I need you here to know it's real
You don't know the half of it
'Til you're caught in the same
And is there comfort with the absence here
While I watch it circle the drain?

[Verse 2]
I know you hate when I'm a mess, I tend to overthink
Why am I always afraid that one day you'll give up on me?
It's too hard and never works, that's just something people say
But I'm still holding on
Yeah, I'm still holding on
[Chorus]
I got another half of me miles away
And now I'm longing something I can't feel
At times I need you here to know it's real
You don't know the half of it
'Til you're caught in the same
And is there comfort with the absence here
While I watch it circle the drain?
The half of me

You know I miss you all of the time
I know I'm safe when I feel your touch
I wanna feel it
I wanna feel it again

I wanna know if I'm tracing over
All your scars help with your closure
And this is tougher than I thought
But I want you to know

"Oh, you say you're lonely
Pulled away by the tide and lost at sea
All you sense is something
So heavy that you can't breathe

You can't breathe

And the sound of the waves takes you away
And the ghosts on the boardwalk keep you company
Where the city meets the sea
Where the city meets the sea

Oh, you say you're empty
Stripped away by the pain of broken dreams
All of these emotions
Clouding up your eyes 'til you can't see

I'm fuckin' her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth, and ass, call that bitch triple-threat
When I was in jail, she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Chorus: Rick Ross + Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car
Yeah, load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big black nigga in a icy watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch, I got a Nike shop
Count the profits, you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans, kick 'em off, they might be hot, swish
I'm swimming in a yellow bitch (Boss)
In the red 911 looking devilish (Haha)
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof 'til he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before (Yeah)
Baby, I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago

[Chorus: Rick Ross + Lil Wayne]
I'm not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car

Yeah, oad up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch, I'm Redd Foxx
Big B's, Red Sox
I get money to kill time, dead clocks
You fucking with a nigga who won't give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I'm in a red bitch, she said she finna cum

The bigger the bullet, the more that bitch go ""Bang""
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint (Yeah)

My first home invasion, papi gave me forty bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape (Yeah)
Ain't it funny, mama only son be bakin' cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather 'round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble, that's the double up (Yeah)

"[Verse 1]
There is a shadow that hides in the walls
It’s there everyday waiting to strangle us all
You might not see it coming, in fact you usually won’t
And you hope that it’ll unwrap its hands from your throat

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the days just drift away
Sometimes it’s hard to see the way
Through all the noise, through all the waste...
And that’s the way we burn

[Chorus 1]
Wake up
I’m burning alive
Cause it’s like a killing desire
So messed up
You’d trade your whole life
For a fucking minute on fire

[Verse 2]
There’s a black cat staring back at me
Every time I look outside
I don’t know his agenda but I tend
To be reminded of mistakes I’ve made
They play on a loopIn my mind
But what business does an animal without a soul
Have to concern itself with mine?
[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the days just drift away
Sometimes it’s hard to see the way
And I know I could save today or
Go insane today, I guess I’ll never learn
And when I try a voice inside’s
Always screaming “Fuck it, watch me burn!”

[Chorus 1]
Wake up
I’m burning alive
Cause it’s like a killing desire
So messed up
You’d trade your whole life
For a fucking minute on fire

[Chorus 2]
You’ll never know
You’ll never know
How far you’ll go
Until you’re right on the verge
And end up cutting the wire
For a minute on fire

Wake up
I’m burning alive
Cause it’s like a killing desire
So messed up

How far you’ll go

I don't want you to know too much about me, oh no
'Cause I know you'll take advantage of the words that I say
You're looking for a way to depress me, make me pay

You don't want me to be too close around you 'cause I would see
All the weak sides that you got, but which you're trying to hide
You know that I would nail you if I could nurse my pride

[Chorus 1]
You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy
Yeah, we're lacking energy

It's a mindgame we play, rule the roost, major cliche
While one of us is fit the other's going insane
And every time we think the positions will remain

You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me

I'll get back on top and be carefree

I know we're thinking the same and our opponent's the one to blame
Thinking this way is not something that we both longed for
Living this way is something that we never did plan
But I don't think that we'll change
'Cause we're stuck in roles as other's antipoles

[Chorus 2]
You're on the top when I am low
As soon as you're fading I will grow
I don't like you, you don't like me
We're lacking energy

I called you last night, were you asleep?
Or did you let it ring avoiding me?
You said you needed time to think
And space to process what it means

So I wrote it down instead
All the things that night
I would’ve said

I drew stick figures of you and I on a hillside
Stick figures of you and me, don’t you agree?

Better than the ’96 Bulls ever were

Wouldn’t have known what had hit them

With tears in your eyes from your late night drive
I know you’re scared and so am I

I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure, did you hear he fucked her?
A day late, a buck short, I'm writing the report
On losing and failing, when I move, I'm flailing now

And it's happened once again, I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands, and sees through the master plan
But everybody's gone, and I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well, I guess this is growing up

Well, I guess this is growing up

You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy

She kisses everyone goodbye
And waves her middle finger high
They're never gonna mess with her again
The drama queen is seventeen
And sleeping with the boys for free
She's got a reputation of being easy

Every time they put her down
She makes a fist and tears roll down
She packs her bags and plans to run away

And leaving tonight
She's wasted all her lonely tear drops
She's saying goodbye
And leaving tonight
She's used up all her lonely tear drops now

And cares about nobody else
Because the only friends she has all put her down
They hate her when she's beautiful
And even more when she's a fool
They talk behind her back when it's her birthday

Every time they put her down
She makes a fist and tears roll down
She packs her bags and plans to run away

I need a short-term fix for a long-term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one-track mind I don't think I can change
Trapped in memories stuck on replay, replay, replay

Burning me up
Burning me up
A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up

Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart

Washing over me like rain

Of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name
Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me

"Once there was a time when we could learn
All the simple pleasantries a follower should yearn
Now all that I can do is watch them burn
And wish that I could save them all, or just one

Hear Him Speak of all the things that we need to hear, to adhere

Justify, your secrecies that surmise your cries
I see the way you look around the bend
Is it going to end, when?

The visions that I've seen have left me torn
Between the resurrection and the prophecy unborn
I think that I will document the fall
And say I hate to say it, but I told you all

Hear Him Speak of all the things that we need to hear, to adhere

Before you go, you've got some questions
And you want answers
But now you’re old, cold, covered in blood
Right back to where you started from... (from...)

[Chorus]
These are the chronicles of
Life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives
As fictional as they may seem

[Post-Chorus]
You come in this world, and you go out just the same
Today could be the worst day of your life...

"[Verse 1]
They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

[Chorus]
They said ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

[Verse 2]
The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

[Chorus]
They said ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah

They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""

"I've got a book of matches
I've got a can of kerosene
I've got some bad ideas
Involving you and me
I don't blame you for walking away
I touched myself at thoughts of flames
I shat the bed, I laid there in it
Thinking of you, wide awake for days
And I found you tongue-tied
In my twisted little brain
You couldn't crack a smile
I didn't catch your name
I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
In four short steps we can erase this
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house
Step four, stop off at Edgebrook Creek
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one
I'm like a broken record
I've got a needle scratching me
It injects the poisons
Of alcohol IV

I don't blame you for walking away
I'd do the same if I saw me
I swear it's not contagious
Swear to God it's not contagious

Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house

Step four, stop at Lake Michigan
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands
I couldn't meet them so you cut off my fingers, one by one

This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
Love for fire
This could be love
For fire, forever more
Step one, slit my throat
Step two, play in my blood
Step three, cover me in dirty sheets
And run laughing out of the house

Step four stop off at Berkeley Marina
And rinse your crimson hands
You took me hostage and made your demands

Under your spell again
I can't say no to you

I can't breathe but I feel

Can't believe that I feel

You hold me down, right on time, love of my life
You showed up, and showed me so wrong, you were right
Alone in this ocean, floating in the moonlight
At home with the notion it’s me, myself, and I

I was the live fast, car crash, Mulholland Drive
Open the flood gates, this love-hate is making me cry
But tears fill the tub with the blood from your wrist that night

If we should live forever
Like sweet vampires
When we can reign together
Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties
But it’s me and you
And the skies are blue
Both bleeding from our eyes

[Verse 3]
I was a love-sick, dumb dick, top off the stock
Came to shove, when you push and locked his keys in his car
I feel like an animal that’s been kicked around too long
An eel who's electric circuitry that’s been wired all wrong

Our own empire
Now we should try to sever
All our past ties

Now where the hell have you
Gone off and flown away to
Some shithole you call home (some asshole)
Told me I won’t survive
Somehow, I’m scraping by
We’re reduced to ruin
Rubble, rags and bones

Our own empire
Now we should try to sever

Been lost at sea inside a house off Driftwood Avenue, and I

Some of them rise, some of them fall

And serenade him basking in the sun on my front porch

Please call me only
If you are coming home
Waste another year flies by
Waste a night or two
You taught me how to live

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
In the streets of shame
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain
There's no signs of hope
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope
There's a glow of light
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night
Bearing gifts and trust
A fixture in the city of lust

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
What the hell's your name? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
What's your pleasure and what is your pain? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you dream too much? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Do you think what you need is a crutch?
[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
In the crowd of pain
St. Jimmy comes without any shame
He says, ""We're fucked up, but we're not the same
And Mom and Dad are the ones you can blame""

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Jimmy died today (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
He blew his brains out into the bay (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
In the state of mind (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It's my own private suicide
[Part 2: East 12th St.]

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares, well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?

[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Jesus filling out paperwork now
At the facility on East 12th Street
He's not listening to a word now
He's in his own world, and he's daydreaming
He'd rather be doing something else now
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
His life's on the line with anxiety now
She had enough, and he had plenty
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the fuck right out of here

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ah-ah) So far away, I don't wanna stay (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me out of here right now (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) I just wanna be free, is there a possibility? (La-la-la)
(Ah-ah) Get me out of here right now
(Out, out, out, out) Right!
This life-like dream ain't for me!

[Part 3: Nobody Likes You]

[Verse 4: Mike Dirnt]
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee and you're still not here
Dreaming of a song, but something went wrong
And you can't tell anyone, 'cause no one's here

[Pre-Chorus]
Left me here alone
And I shoulda stayed home
After ten cups of coffee I'm thinking...
[Chorus: Mike Dirnt]
(Where'd you go?) Nobody likes you, everyone left you
(Where'd you go?) They're all out without you, havin' fun
(Where'd you go?) Everyone left you, nobody likes you
(Where'd you go?) They're all out without you, havin' fun

[Bridge: Mike Dirnt]
(Where'd you go, go, go, go?)
[Part 4: Rock and Roll Girlfriend]

[Intro: Tré Cool]
Jeez! *sigh*

[Verse 5: Tré Cool & Billie Joe Armstrong]
I got a rock and roll band, I got a rock and roll life
I got a rock and roll girlfriend and another ex-wife
I got a rock and roll house, I got a rock and roll car
I play the shit out the drums, and I can play the guitar
I got a kid in New York, I got a kid in the Bay
I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over twenty-two days
(Don't want to be an American idiot!)
So get off my case, off of my case, off of my case!
[Part 5: We're Coming Home Again]

[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Hey!

[Verse 6: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Here they come, marching down the street (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Coming back from the edge of town
Underneath their feet
Their time has come, and it's goin' nowhere (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Nobody ever said that life was fair, now (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bare
In the summer heat

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
The world is spinning 'round and 'round out of control again
The 7-11 to the fear of breaking down
So send my love a letterbomb, and visit me in Hell
We're the ones going...

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

[Bridge: Billie Joe Armstrong]
(Ooh) I started fuckin' running as soon as my
(Ooh) Feet touched ground
(Ooh) We're back in the barrio
(Ooh) And to you and me, that's Jingle Town

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt, Tre Cool]
That's home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again
Home, we're coming home again

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

But though you're still with me

Take it slow
Tell me all how you've grown, just for me
Could we all reminisce?
Better yet, here's a pen
Make a list
Fill it full with all the things I've missed
'Cause I could barely drive past the school
Without stopping to think of you
And how we used to act the fool
But worst of all I wish I'd called
At least a thousand times or more
Just to hear what I've been missing

[Chorus]
If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here
[Verse 2]
Thinking back on the days
Where we all used to say
""I know anywhere's better than here""
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the ice on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)
As the song that your life ended with

If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad

Can't help but think that it should've been me

And they say you're in a better place
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah, they say you're in a better place
Too bad it's not what I believe

'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
In the end, I just wish you were here

To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the streets
Chased down like dogs we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
Cause sometimes dreams just don't come true
Look now at what they've done to you

White needles buried in the red
The engine roars and then it gives
But never dies
Cause we don't live
We just survive
On the scraps that you throw away

[Verse 4]
I won't crawl on my knees for you
I won't believe the lies that hide the truth
I won't sweat one more drop for you
Cause we are the rust upon your gears
We are the insect in your ears
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl
All over you

We sow the seeds to see us through
Our days are precious and so few
We all reap what we are due
Under this sky no longer blue
We bring the dawn long overdue

In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be
But you're killing everything in me

[Bridge]
I'm done, there's nothing left to show
I try but can't let it go
Are you happy where you're standing still?
Do you really want the sugar pill?
I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll start
Tonight it feels so hard
As the train approaches Gare Du Nord
As I'm sure your kiss remains employed
Am I only dreaming?

You say that love goes anywhere
In your darkest time, it's just enough to know it's there
When you go, I'll let you be

The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Verse 1]
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far

[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, ""What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!"" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Post-Chorus]
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark
[Verse 2]
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark

What a shame! Hey!"" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

It’s time I should be leaving, it’s time for me to go
A painting on my ceiling and your footprints in the snow
They found you Christmas morning beneath the tree in the front yard
The sound, the screams, the mourning
As we send sympathy cards

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
Hydrocodone acid-washed brain
A shame, a total loss
They said that they did all they could
That boy's been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
The sour power of surprise
A ticker out of time and whack
Too young to die of heart attacks

[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
I guess I should be going, there’s nothing I can say
To keep your dad from throwing up at least 3 times a day
They found you Christmas morning beneath the tree in the backyard
The pounding of your mother’s fist while freezing in the car

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
Oxycodone acid-washed brain
A shame, a total loss
They said that they did all they could
That boy's been dead since childhood
Leave me alone to analyze
The sour power of surprise
A ticker out of time and whack
Too young to die of heart attacks

I’d kill for a drink (Fetch me a drink)
Casket to carry
Try not to think (Try not to think)

Turn a page, I'm a book half unread

Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
And I'm over

Then I would never let another day go by

While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy

Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel reckless, I wanna live it up, just because

Living for the weekend state of mind Makes me sick
Just thinking of the bad habits
People passing out in parking lots
That you only live once way of thinking
It’s so twisted are you living or just wasted
An escape 'cause you can’t face it

If a psycho said this is the end
I think I’d believe him

Now the whole world is full of it
Building a bunker and jumping in
After everyone self-destructs
Pop the hatch and we’ll climb back up

This self-centered generation taking pictures
Of themselves then changing features
Pleasing over critical creatures
Everyones got a cause but how strong is the foundation?
Moving like the waves of the ocean
Do you care or just throw stones in?
If a billboard read this was the end
I think I’d believe it

I got myself together I would watch me fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't let that happen again
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

[Refrain]
Stop right there, that's exactly where I lost it
See that line? I never should have crossed it
Stop right there, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) Well, I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
[Chorus]
I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

[Bridge]
Who I am hates who I've been
And who I am will take the second chance You gave me
Who I am hates who I've been
'Cause who I've been only ever made me

[Chorus]
So sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

Don't waste your time on me, you're already

Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already

Don't waste your time on me, you're already

"Story of my life, story of my life
Well let's just say it's a fork and a knife
There's one thing on my mind, one thing all the time
I gotta fill my mouth
Got no favorite meal, got no favorite meal
I say every meal is clean if it fills me up for real
My belly's big and that's just the start
My appetite's my heart

And when I've had enough, I just throw up and laugh
But this time, this time
It's not a cow
Kind of personal, can't explain to you why
No, this time, this time
It's not a cow
So Mr. PC are you ready to bow

Breakfast in bed, breakfast in bed
The bed's in the kitchen so it's easy to be fed
And when I'm fed, yes, when I am fed
I go right back to bed
Food and sleep watch, food and sleep watch
These things should keep me from having too much
My belly is big and that's just the start
My appetite's my heart
Sometimes it feels that I could kill for dessert
This time, this time
It's not a cow
It's kind of personal, can't explain to you why
No, this time, this time
It's not a cow
So Mr. PC are you ready to bow

Story of my life
A big fork and the sharpest knife
I guess this solid, solid, solid, solid bridge leads me on
To the nearest fridge

And when I've had enough, I just throw up and laugh
So this time, this time
It's not a cow
It's kind of personal, can't explain to you why
No, this time, this time
It's not a cow
So Mr. PC are you ready to bow

This time, this time
It's not a cow, not a cow
No, this time, this time, this time, this time

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

[Verse 1]
I guess we'll never know
If when we're gone there's a place to go
Or if we don't see anything at all
Is that what we're supposed to call faith?
Well if that is that, and it all just fades to black
And we don't see anything at all
We don't see anything
What are you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

[Verse 2]
The world is a funny place
It kicks you when you're down
And knocks you out when you get up again
I don't think it's worth suffering through
But on the other hand
There's a world full of possibilities
And a million other people just like you
Who've all been through what you've been through
They were singing...

Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me

I saw it all flash and pass by with bright lights
And right before my eyes was the exit sign
I saw it all flash and pass by
And asked why I wasted precious time
It just passed me by
It just passed me by
We are just passing by (Just passing by)
Just passing by
Oh we are just passing by (Just passing by)
Just passing by

Pain, pain go away, come back another day

Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?

Trying to find some peace along the way
Wish I knew how long I'm supposed to wait

There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
There's always a reason for the pain

I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
Will you even look back when you think of me?

While everyone around me says my last days are looming
Overhead, but what the hell do they think they know?

Some say now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
[Chorus]
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part
Is letting go of your dreams

[Verse 2]
A drink for the horror that I'm in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again

[Pre-Chorus]
And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye

[Chorus]
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part's
The awful things that I've seen
[Post-Chorus]
""Sometimes I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always
I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always""
Just sleep
""Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always""
Just sleep
""Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always""

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
The bible of ""none of the above""
On a steady diet of
Soda-pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in Hell
As far as I can tell
'Least the ones I got away with

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Verse 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
Doing someone else's cocaine
[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me

[Part II: City of the Damned]

[Verse 3: Billie Joe Armstrong]
At the center of the Earth, in the parking lot
Of the 7-Eleven where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says ""home is where your heart is,"" but what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care
[Verse 4: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt]
City of the dead (Hey! Hey!)
At the end of another lost highway (Hey! Hey!)
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned (Hey! Hey!)
Lost children with dirty faces today (Hey! Hey!)
No one really seems to care (Hey!)

[Verse 5: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Everyone's so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled, but never saved
From the cradles to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia!

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe

I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented, or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

(Ooh, ooh) Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?

[Verse 8: Billie Joe Armstrong]
To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies

[Verse 9: Billie Joe Armstrong]
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the lights of masochists

And I've walked this line

"[Intro: Matt Skiba]
Blame it, blame it on my youth

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

[Chorus: Matt Skiba]
You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
(Blame, blame, blame on my youth)
[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You could never kill my high

Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

Ever since I was a little kid (Little kid)
No one ever seemed to give a shit (Give a shit)

Stressed out
Cut up
Kicked out
Chewed up
Spat out
Left the fuck out

Please pick your collision course

Can’t see where we’re going
Road to ruin lies ahead
Please brace for turbulence

Going off the grid, don’t care
This way to certain death
This Kamikaze

Senses gone completely numb
What the hell have I become?
Deep down we know how this ends
No regard for consequence

So tell me what is your childhood trauma, let’s measure up
And we can figure out who’s the most fucked up
What is your goddamn problem?
I’ll tell you mine:
Struggling
Ugly

Crying
In
Depression
Everything’s fine
Please pick your collision course

Can’t see where we’re going
Road to ruin lies ahead
Please brace for turbulence

Will King: Tell me how much time you got?
Do you wanna fucking start one?
Will King: Alright, is this what you want?
Yeah

Will King: Violent ends
I’ve burnt away all my history
Vicious cycles
Kept me in from breaking free
And now it’s far too late
To change your mind and turn around
This plane’s coming down

Can’t see where we’re going
Road to ruin lies ahead

Get ready for action!

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus]
This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Both]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)

"[Verse 1]
By the time I was your age, I'd give anything
To fall in love truly, was all I could think
That's when I met your mother, the girl of my dreams
The most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen
She said, ""Boy can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I can't help but notice, you're staring at me
I know I shouldn't say this, but I really believe
I can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me.""

[Chorus 1]
Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things

[Verse 2]
Now, most of the time we'd have too much to drink
And we'd laugh at the stars and we'd share everything
Too young to notice and too dumb to care
Love was a story that couldn't compare
I said, ""Girl, can I tell you a wonderful thing?
I made you a present with paper and string
Open with care now, I'm asking you, please
You know that I love you, will you marry me?""

[Chorus 2]
Now, son, I'm only telling you this
Because life can do terrible things
You'll learn, one day, I'll hope and I'll pray
That God shows you differently
[Verse 3]
She said, ""Boy can I tell you a terrible thing?
It seems that I'm sick and I've only got weeks
Please, don't be sad now, I really believe
You were the greatest thing that ever happened to me.""

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Slow, so slow I fell to the ground on my knees
So don't fall in love, there's just too much to lose
If you're given the choice, then I beg you to choose
To walk away, walk away, don't let her get you
I can't bear to see the same happen to you

Because life can do terrible things38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout

I haven't been home for a while, I'm sure everything's the same
Mom and dad both in denial, an only child to take the blame
Sorry mom, but I don't miss you, father's no name you deserve
I'm just a kid with no ambitions, wouldn't come home for the world
You'll never know what I've become, the king of all that's said and
Done, the forgotten son
This city's buried in defeat, I walk along these no name streets
Wave goodbye to all as I fall...

[Verse 1]
At the dead end I begin to burn the bridge of innocence
Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
A shallow grave I have dug all by myself

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

You regret you made me, it's too late to save me

And he said, ""Far as I can tell, it's just voices in my head
Am I talking to myself 'cause I don't know what I just said?""

Am I at the end of nowhere, is this as good as it gets?""

I wanna start by letting you know this
Because of you, my life has a purpose
You helped me be who I am today

Trapped in a world where everyone hates me
There's so much that I'm going through
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you

Sometimes I feel like you've known me forever
You always know how to make me feel better
Because of you my dad and me
Are so much closer than we used to be
You're my escape when I'm stuck in a small town
I turn you up whenever I feel down
You let me know like no one else
That it's okay to be myself

I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air

Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me

They don't feel me but they fear me

"[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade""

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Post-Chorus]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all

[Bridge]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care
[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on)

"[Verse 1]
This is a story 'bout a friend of mine; he's abnormally intelligent
He could bust a phatty rhyme, even when he got up in the blunt
But that all changed when the girl who he lives with came to town He let her take him away from me and so I had to ask him how

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when he said
""She takes advantage of me
She takes advantage of me
She takes advantage of me
She takes advantage of me
She even knows when I pee
I think eventually
She'll make a meal out of me""

[Chorus]
Because her love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without
Your love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without
One of these days I swear I'm gonna get out
'Til then your love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without

[Verse 2]
That's why I'm talking to you now
Sarah lives with Bradley now, I guess that is how she wants her shit
He needed a place to stay, so it's of mutual benefit
I stopped by on my way to Pomona yesterday
She sat down and spilled her guts to me
That's when I thought she would tell me she's gay
[Pre-Chorus]
Instead she said
""He takes advantage of me
He takes advantage of me
He takes advantage of me
He takes advantage of me
He even knows when I pee
I think eventually
He'll make a meal out of me""

Because her love is a mutt from hell that I can't live without

What happened to you?
You played the victim for so long now in this game
What I thought was true

But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in

I'm falling

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm in over my head
For something I said
Completely misread, I'm better off dead
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

[Verse 2]
It's none of my concern
Don't look to me 'cause I don't believe in fame
I guess you never heard
I met our makers they don't even know your name
But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well

This came long before, those who suffer more
I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
What's with my disgrace I've lost the human race
No one plans for it to, blow up in their face

Who said it was so easy to put back all these pieces?

Is it time I befriended all the ghosts of all the things that haunt me most
So they leave me alone
Move on with my life
Be certain the steps of left and right don't fight the direction of upright

If I become what I can't accept

It's time to decide
Which is out of my mind
'Cause it'll be me unless I put some thoughts to rest and leave some faults behind

Shine off the spring in my step
And it could be blinding depending on the amount of You that I reflect

"The first wedensday i saw her
There smiling at me with here blue eyes
And curly hair i couldn't wait till next week
To make the stop see her at the
Quick check paper drop

Every wedensday we'd count the papers
We'd have a laugh at the people in their suits
No one seemed to notice how she was different
But i did and i knew. Another wedensday came and it
Seemed it was right so i wrote her a note that i
Hoped she would like dear
Kiah would you like to go with me to the boardwalk
What fun it will be
We'll eat cotton candy and we'll get french
Fries with vinegar and get a
Plate of funnel cake then we'll go on the
Zipper look out on the ocean
And puke it all up all the people will scream
We can have a laugh what do
You say? that's what it said in the note
Another week went by
And she never called another week came and
She wished she had she just
Broke up with her fiance and things were kinda crazy
With her i said i understood, another week went by
And she never called but i thought
About the way she looked at me and said to myself maybe..
I pulled into the quick check at 6am to see the sun coming up
When i walked in Kiah wasn't there. The manager said
She quit she isn't here do you want me to
Help you count the papers?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I'm no good
I feel too small
Something's gotta burn
Sick on you
Drunken highways
Someone take the wheel

Faded in the blackout you left me in
It's safer on the outside
I'm swimming in this kerosene
It's hard to breathe
The static's got me down

I can't sleep
I'm disconnected
Everything went wrong
And certain stars
Are sad and bruised like someone's cheating heart

"[Verse 1: Jake Bundrick]
Katy, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest, and the hardest part is letting
Go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling, and you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best

[Verse 2: Derek Sanders]
You're all that I hoped I'd find in every single way
And everything I would give is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something, I just haven't found it yet
But I need it, so
[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes

I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess, but I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best

[Verse 3: Jake Bundrick]
And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly, so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares

"[Verse 1]
It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

[Verse 2]
There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!
[Verse 3]
And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

Hold me up underneath this heavy burden

Tied up to a heart of stone, I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

You came from Santa Monica

We passed out in the shadows
Of a lonely Thursday night

And fucked away the pain
We went out for some coffee
And then we did it all again

Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung

Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne & Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why
[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve65EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

He said, ""Son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say, if I said that you could?
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid""
I said, ""That sounds pretty good""
Black leather boots, spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair, but it looks alright
We marched and we sang, we all became friends
As we learned how to fight

[Chorus 1]
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

[Verse 2]
I kicked in the door, I yelled my commands
The children, they cried, but I got my man
We took him away, a bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes, they pissed in his hands
I told them to stop, but then I joined in
We beat him with guns, and batons not just once
But again and again
[Chorus 1]
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

[Verse 3]
She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop, I begged her to stay
But she pressed on, so I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand that the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

[Chorus 2]
A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

Like time is not a crocodile

Pull the curtains back
I think my neighborhood's on fire again
The kids are not alright it seems
At least they went outside this time

And they already gave the first place medal

That sunless morning
I got my start on the mean streets
Where Damen and Division meet
Been dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning

You're not in love you're just insane
Afraid of everything, everything, everything and the shame
It wipes that smile right off your face
Lost in confusion and disgrace

"I saw you walking past me just the other day
Another heartbeat with thoughts of yesterday
You looked the same, years are only time
I still wonder why our hearts could never rhyme

You stood beside me, you didn't recognize me
Funny how some things never change

And when you walked on by a memory surprised me
Smoking cigarettes with your girlfriends by the pool
Your smell I could not forget, that's as close as I could get
You were so fucking cool

I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?
I'm no good, you're no better
Wouldn't we be perfect together?

All I wanted was a piece of your heart
You left me torn apart
Fuck the rest before me and their crimes
For your love I'll serve their time

Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I’ll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

Don’t hold me up now
I can stand my own ground

You will let me down, down, down!

We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry and the cold
We are the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we’ve been sweating
While you slept so calm in the safety of your home
We’ve been pulling out the nails
That hold up everything you’ve known

Don’t hold me up now

So open your eyes, child
Let’s be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We’ll sing through the day
Of the lives that we’ve lost
And the lives we’ve reclaimed
Go!

Sleeping on the roof
Drinking all the alcohol
All the kids from school
Will be naked in the pool
While our parents are on Fire Island

Cranking up the tunes
'Til the windows break
Feeding chocolate to the dog
Jumping on the couch
'Til the feathers all come out
While our parents are on Fire Island

We're old enough by now
To take care of each other
We don't need no babysitter
We don't need no father or mother

And I want you wrapped around me, but I don't trust myself
I drove by your house, but you don't live there anymore

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?
I really wish I hated you

[Bridge: Mark Hoppus, Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
I can see that you've had enough
I can see that you're giving up on me
I can see that your hands are up
I can see that you're giving up on me
I hate the way that you're better off, better off
I numb the pain but it never stops, never stops
Wish I could say that I'm better off, better off now
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus, Mark Hoppus & Matt Skiba]
But I don't really like myself without you
Every song I sing is still about you
Save me from myself the way you used to
'Cause I don't really like myself without you
I really wish I hated you right now
Won't you say something?
Won't you say something?

Won't you say something?

About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of
The optimist in me

Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

I say ""Well, maybe if you wanna go blind""
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer

Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet

Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes

Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight

I can't believe I hung around with, you
All this time
You drove me crazy with your OCD
Girl you're out of your mind
I'm counting on UFO's to beam me up
I just don't know
How long I can take this shit
I'm over it girl you gotta go

It's over, we're over
Just like in crimson and clover
Were sinking and I'm thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid
It's the end, ex girlfriend
I don't care what you think of me now
So long you're gone
This is the break up song

[Verse 2]
One more thing before you go
Would you please give me my records back
My bloody valentine, the pixies
Cheap trick and back in black
You can keep the dog we bought
But you can't go near the standard bar
Don't hang around, don't call my friends
They won't know who you are

It's over, we're over

Were sinking and I'm thinking

I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen

Just let it happen

It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing has changed

And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

[Bridge]
And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with the blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around

Ugh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with Five-O

Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold

These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches

What's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, one-eighty-seven
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass, TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want

Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy

To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt

I am a wannabe
You'd better be careful around me
I come from far away
Where Mustang dreams are made
And we are fashioned in the image of the dons who have come before us
We all kiss the rings of sand like our fathers told us

Cause I'm a...
A wannabe gangstar, better go back to Commack
I'm a wannabe gangstar, you better go back to Commack
I'm a wannabe gangstar, you better go back to Commack

Like a lemon pie a la mode
My nine is easy to load
All hail Jericho
Turnpike Tech, that's where I go
To learn the things about the universe I'll need
So I can build a stampede
Because I'm all up in your face again
I'm all up in your face

[Verse 3]
A wannabe gangstar
A victim of the chromosome prankster
I thanks ya
I sits back in my chair to contemplate my hair
(Damn)
But yo, I'm looking snappy
I'm nappy, I'm crappy
Got jimmy hats from Pappy
So now I'm trigger-happy
(Girl, did he just rhyme ""nappy"" with ""crappy""?!)
Yeah, so...
You girlies wanna get with this nit-wit, got Cheez Whiz or not?
Then I might have to blow up your mail box
Or bii-ahtch...
Or toilet-paper your front yard
Show the cops my suburbs card
They got to let me go, cause they know that I'm hard
It's the deal, it's for real
You better listen what I'm telling you
Cause I'm a wannabe gangstar

Hey I'm a wannabe gangstar, better go back to Commack

"[Verse 1]
Constellations
Rising and falling
Complications
Blame it on myths and stories
And I've been kinda hoping
That it was just a mistake
You're feeling out of your place
Time after time it's what I get for
Believing in higher places
Downfall
Ignorance wasn't important
Maybe I could've seen it
But I guess I never learn
I keep on hoping harder
I'll set myself up for closure

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel like nothing left?
Do you grow a sense of regret?
'Cause I don't wanna know but I wanna know
Was this our fate after all?

[Chorus]
I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, you left, left
I've seen every stage of grief I can over again
Are you feeling whole again?
Is this separation how it ends?
'Cause I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, I'll live
[Verse 2]
Never ending
Don't wanna leave when I'm still healing
Give me back my energy, I'm
Too weak to clean up this mess
Unwoven bound to undress
It's all too hard to predict
I can't choose the words on your lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel like nothing left?
Do you grow a sense of regret?
'Cause I don't wanna know but I wanna know
Was this our fate after all?

[Chorus]
I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, you left, left
I've seen every stage of grief I can over again
Are you feeling whole again?
Is this separation how it ends?
'Cause I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, I'll live

Do you feel like nothing left?
Do you grow a sense of regret?
'Cause I don't wanna know, but I wanna know
Was this our fate after all?
Been pushing and pulling, but I can't consume it
Our souls in disguises let this end
[Chorus]
I've been holding onto what was Siamese souls, you left, left
I've seen every stage of grief I can over again
Are you feeling whole again?
Is this separation how it ends?

"[Verse 1: Ben Barlow]
Yesterday saw you missing
Drawn to the light in the distance
Holding her hand while she listened
She told him how much she would miss him
Said his goodbyes to his children
And let the weight fade away

[Verse 2: Ben Barlow & Laura Whiteside (together)]
I have your hands
But I have my mother's eyes
Your tact and poise
And her sense of wrong and right
Heard you awake in the middle of the night
Letting go of the things you keep inside

[Verse 3: Ben Barlow]
Worked your fingers to the bone
To be sent home with a cardboard box
Filled with everything you've known
All things come to be loved and lost

[Verse 4: Ben Barlow & Laura Whiteside (together)]
I'll keep a moment sealed in time inside a picture frame
A small reminder of the days I thought would never change
They always say it's clear to see
How parts of you shine through in me
I think you know, you won't be here forever
And you're counting down the days
'Til you can rest your tired eyes and let it slip away
[Verse 5: Ben Barlow]
The lessons learned at your side
Will stay with me all my life
The man I hope to become, I know is deep down inside
I know, you don't even need to say
I know you're proud in your own way
I know you're proud in your own way

[Outro: Ben Barlow & Laura Whiteside (together)]
And you watched me grow up
As I watched you grow older
The chip off your block, held me up on your shoulders
I wish I told you yesterday

Don't leave it out for another day

And you're the one always beside me
When I'm lost you're always to guide me
It's about time that I gave you something back, something back
And I'm the one selfish and greedy
Never cared enough of what you needed

"There's a king upon the throne
He's the king there all alone
He seems troubled and a little sad
Just when you thought that he was glad
To be the ruler of the earth
Could it be, it wasn't worth
More than nothing?

From the day that he was born
In his side there was a thorn
He just couldn't find the key
To be happy and be free
He felt forced to wear the crown
Slowly it will drag him down
Into nothing

One more drink and you are learning how to fly
Everything turns perfect once you reach the sky
Pop another pill, don't wanna leave your dream
Forget about the days of when you swam upstream
And don't you care too much 'bout you feel inside
It is probably nothing

I never told you 'bout my dream
How I saw us as a team
We would free the universe
With a chorus and a verse
We were gonna make a change
But like how every dream is strange
It's also nothing
What was goin' through your mind
What kind of truth did you find
What did you see from the top
That would finally make you stop
Did it give peace to your soul
Like you reached your final goal
Or just nothing?

One more drink and you are learning how to fly
Everything turns perfect once you reach the sky
Pop another pill, don't wanna leave your dream
Forget about the days of when you swam upstream
And don't you care too much 'bout what you feel inside
It is probably nothing

On and on, on the road, never-ending
Keep a smile up, make sure you're pretending
It's been a long while since you ate the bait

On and on, you're no fish in the water
But you're slowly on your way to the slaughter
Before you know, everything's too late

One more drink and you are learning how to fly
Everything turns perfect once you reach the sky
Pop another pill, don't wanna leave your dream
Forget about the days of when you swam upstream
And as I hear your song play on the radio
A certain sadness in me always starts to grow
Will I ever understand the reason why
The melodies make me both wanna smile and cry
And all the things you make me feel inside
Are anything but nothing1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Looking for something to waken my soul
It seems like its singing stopped cold
I got used to being the star of the show

I heard a song playing brought by the wind

Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep
Then I'll rest in your ground
But these days the world is against us
So keep me safe with your fields and fences around me

I want to start living
I want to be brave
I want to find where I belong
'Cause I still remember the reasons I write
Things that I've dreamed for so long

I heard a song playing brought by the wind
I got myself lost, then I found you again

Tennessee, when I finally lay down to sleep
Then I'll rest in your ground
But these days the world is against us
So keep me safe with your fields and fences around me, around me

Is it okay if I speak to you today?
You've been pissed off for a week now
But, nothing I can say could make you look up
Or crack up. Is there anything that I can't do
Anything to show you

You're a bitch
But, I love you anyway
Oh, oh you can't sing

When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""

Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then

"I was alone, I decided to get up, decided to get out
I picked up the phone and I gave my boys a shout
Told them I'd be out around nine, no particular plan
Just whatever comes to mind

Bryan called me up, said there's a show tonight
Do you want to go tonight, I'm giving my girl the night off
'Cause I'm hanging out with Steinkopf
Whenever I'm down, I know where my friends can be found
Whenever there's a doubt, I just have to shout

He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time

Another night and we got somewhere to go
Going out, meeting up at the punk rock show
Where the air is hot and the music is loud
My kind of place, this is my kind of crowd

And we'll be here 'til the night is through
Loyal to my friends and sworn to fun

When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

People will stare but we won't care

Again I am repeating myself
And I know it is time for you
To sit and pretend

Damn regret

Don't worry about me
'Cause I'll be fine
Cast my line
To see what's behind
Did you think you'd persuade me to let you go?

I'm wishing you were here
My weakness is my fear
Alone I am myself
No reason left for me to care
Distracted by the sound
I hear footsteps all around
Empowered by adrenaline

"Well, she picked me up in a German car
And she took me out to an Irish bar
Where I drank some beer in a plastic cup
'Til I had some trouble standing up

And then she drove downtown to a strobe-lit space
Where all the guys wore chains and the thumping bass
Was so intense I could barely feel my face
Then I think I asked her back to my place

But that's all I recall
And when I woke up in the hall
I was alone and softly groaning
And I lost my keys, and I lost my phone

And I wondered what I did or said
That I might soon regret
It was the night I can't remember
With the girl I can't forget

Well, I was reeling, watching the ceiling spin
The next evening when my friends walked in
And when I asked them if they knew where I'd been
They didn't speak at first, they only grinned

You see, I'm not the type to get in fights
But that might not have been the case last night
Because they heard that I had a word or two
With the man who asked, ""Is she with you?""
And if I took it the wrong way
I guess that's not for me to say
Though it seems I may have slipped up
When I offered him some grooming tips

But at least that helps explain
The cuts and bruises on my head
From the night I can't remember
With the girl I can't forget

And it's all coming back now
Don't know how to react now
Guess I'll let it go
I'm not so sure I want to know

Well, I was back at work at 9:15
When a message popped up on my screen
It said, ""Pick me up at 8:45
And we can give it one more try""

And now that I'm with her
The whole thing seems a bit absurd
Though she never fails to tell the tale
Of the time she had to post my bail

And for giving me a second chance
I'm forever in her debt
Since the night I can't remember
She's the girl I will never forgetEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Everything makes sense!
And now I know
There’s no
There’s no cure for psycho
Suddenly it seems
So damn easy just to let you go
There’s no
There’s no cure for psycho
[Verse 3]
Up there on your soapbox, so damn loud
Preaching about mental health
But the only time you give a fuck
Is when it affects yourself

[Verse 4]
You know ya couldn’t find a kinder DEVIL
Gaslighter - expert level

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Strike another match you might become
Architect of your own hell

Hell yeah I looked it up…
Everything makes sense!
And now I know
There’s no
There’s no cure for psycho
Suddenly it seems
So damn easy just to let you go
There’s no
There’s no cure for psycho

[Bridge 1]
You tried to cut me down...
Tell me I was alone...
Felt like a prisoner trapped inside my own home...
You tried to kill me dead...
But I won’t feed your ego...
Sidney Prescott, bitch
I’m in this for the sequel!
There’s no cure for psycho...

[Bridge 2]
Bet you're mad I made it out alive
Fended off your fatal blow
I'd tell you to get some help, but well
There’s no cure for psycho

[Chorus]
Hell yeah I looked it up…
Everything makes sense
And now I know
There’s no
There’s no cure for psycho
Suddenly it seems
So damn easy just to let you go

[Verse 1]
I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creeping about, these people are
Freaking me out these days

[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone, there's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me? And why can't anyone see

[Chorus]
I just wanna live?
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

[Post-Chorus]
Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

[Verse 2]
I rock a lawsuit when I'm going to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Talking on the phone, got an interview
With the Rolling Stone, they're saying
""Now you're rich and now you're famous
Fake-ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Your first hit, aren't you ashamed?""
Of the life, of the life
Of the life we're living

[Chorus]
I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live

[Bridge]
""Stop your messing around, boy!
Better think of your future!
Better make some good plans, boy!""
Said everyone of my teachers
Look out! You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say where we're coming from
We've already seen the worst that this life can bring
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say, yeah, we already know

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me

All I have right now is right here
And right now
All I have right now is right here

[Verse 1]
I want what I want, I always have
When no one cared about me, dreams were all I had
But nightmares grow when no one's listening
And idle thoughts will do their thing
I still feel so much pain here from the past

[Pre-Chorus]
And it cuts like a knife
It feels like a fight to take back your life

[Chorus]
Searching for the meaning, I'm living in these feelings
I'm ready for a reason to believe
Now I'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
With anyone's here, it's never what it seems

[Bridge]
All I have right now is right here

[Verse 2]
I felt too bad about myself
I never thought I was good enough for anybody else
I couldn't look love in the eye, I was too broken to try
Life was a cold song that taught me not to cry
[Pre-Chorus]
And it cuts like a knife
It feels like a fight to take back your life

[Chorus]
Searching for the meaning, I'm living in these feelings
I'm ready for a reason to believe
Now I'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
With anyone's here it's never what it seems

[Verse 3]
How long I waited
Feeling lost, frustrated
Locked out and I'm on my own
Cornered and ain't got no place to go
How long should I stay here all alone?

[Chorus]
Searching for the meaning, I'm living in these feelings
I'm ready for a reason to believe
Now I'm working on my insides 'cause outside there's no reasoning
With anyone's here it's never what it seems

If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's going to happen tonight
Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

[Pre-Chorus]
All I can say I shouldn't say

[Chorus]
Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time

[Verse 2]
All the best DJs are saving their slowest song for last
When the dance is through, it's me and you
Come on, would it really be so bad?
The things we think might be the same
But I won't fight for more
It's just not me to wear it on my sleeve
Count on that for sure

But some blame rests on you
Work and play, they're never okay to mix the way we do

It was the best that you could be for me

I know you were only trying to make it right

Try once again to let you go

If you could go back now, would you say it differently?
If there was no one there, would you open up for me?
If this was the last time that we would ever speak
Could we forgive somehow, could we let it rest in peace?

Stories are lost somewhere behind your eyes
You are a dying breed, you stand alone
I couldn't get through no matter how I tried
You tore me apart but still I love you so

I open my eyes
I try to see, but I’m blinded by the white light
I can’t remember how, I can’t remember why

And I can’t stand the pain
And I can’t make it go away
No, I can’t stand the pain

How could this happen to me?
I've made my mistakes
Got nowhere to run
The night goes on as I’m fading away
I’m sick of this life
I just wanna scream
How could this happen to me?

Everybody’s screaming
I try to make a sound, but no one hears me
I’m slipping off the edge, I’m hanging by a thread
I wanna start this over again
So I try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
And I can’t explain what happened
And I can’t erase the things that I've done
No, I can’t

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me

It's never what you've done, it's what you've done lately
Who cares what you're saying, if no ones listening
You don't have to like me, but you're gonna respect me

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way

Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am
I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable
Reserve my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgment
You don't make me who I am

God help those who help themselves
And forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands
May they never feel burdened again
Yeah, I'll stand up for those who can't

"[Intro]
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
'Til school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it
Like maybe

[Verse 1]
Building a rocket or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Discovering something that doesn't exist
Or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane

[Chorus]
This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be
A million and six times better
So make every minute count
Jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is gonna be a great day
[Verse 2]
Crossing the tundra or building a roller coaster
Or skiing down a mountain of beans
Devising a system for remembering everything
Or synchronizing submarines
Racing chariots, taming tiger sharks
Constructing a portal to Mars
Building a time machine, stretching a rubber tree
Or wailing away on guitars

[Chorus]
This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be
A million and six times better
So make every minute count
Jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way
Today is gonna be a great day

[Bridge]
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Let's put our heads together and design a master plan
We may miss dinner but I know mom will understand
We've got our mission and some pliers
Yogurt, gumballs and desire
And a pocketful of rubber bands
The manual on handstands
A Unicycle, compass
And a camera that won't focus
And a canteen full of soda
Grab a beach towel
Here we go!
(This is Ferb-tastic!)
[Chorus]
This could possibly be the best day ever
And the forecast says that tomorrow will likely be
A million and six times better
So make every minute count
Jump up, jump in and seize the day
And let's make sure that in every single possible way

"It's you and me on a beach
In 1998
Leaning into the breeze
From the willows
And rhythm and grace are reborn in this place
I'm assured the procedure is painless

The taxicab with no brakes
Around the mountain pass
Keep your head in your hands
If anybody asks
What you mean when you were picking a fight
You were only complimenting the waitress
Give us a room with a mountain view
A tiny cabana by the water
Yeah, by the water
And I got a rental for an hour or two
For a ride up the coast and a dip in the ocean

The waterfront is alight
With citronella flame
Tourists flashing the night
From the grottoes
And gathering now on the heel-worn planks
For a drunken promenade or a mambo
And lovers paddle a boat
On the molten bay
Veering into the reeds
On a ripple
And playing it cool in a bar by the pool
With a Caribbean Kiss Amaretto

Give us a room with a mountain view
A tiny cabana by the water
Yeah, by the water
And I got a rental for an hour or two
For a ride up the coast and a dip in the ocean

Get a load of the light in the trees
And the sweet decay on the maritime breeze
The sun's hitching on a weather balloon
And the heat off the tarmac
Burning a hole in a gold afternoon

Give us a room with a mountain view
A tiny cabana by the water
Yeah, by the water
And I got a rental for an hour or two
And a bottle in a cooler
Maps and a big brown towel
It's a beater but today will do
