people's eyes\\nRealising that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself\\nAnd I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else\\nI feel like the man in the story\\nWho saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat\\nTwelve years ago I stood on the shore\\nAnd jumped in and grabbed the coat\\nThe river was rushing toward a waterfall\\nAnd, and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land\\nI let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me\\nIn any case please let me know if there's more I can give you\\nIf nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy\": [\n        \"No Friend\",\n        \"Paramore\"\n    ],\n    \"[Verse 1]\\nI can't
