trick and back in black\\nYou can keep the dog we bought\\nBut you can't go near the standard bar\\nDon't hang around, don't call my friends\\nThey won't know who you are\\n[Chorus x 2]\\nIt's over, we're over\\nJust like in crimson and clover\\nWere sinking and I'm thinking\\nHow the hell did we get so stupid\\nIt's the end, ex girlfriend\\nI don't care what you think of me now\\nSo long you're
