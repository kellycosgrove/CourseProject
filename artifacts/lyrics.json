me\\u2019s missing\\nSo I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening\\nI tried to make us a life here\\nBut our foundation was built on sand\\nNo time to run until the damage was done\\nAnd I\\u2019ve never had the upper hand\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nI still wish you the best of luck, baby\\nAnd don't go thinking that this was a waste of time\\nI couldn't forget you if I tried\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou killed what was left of the good in me\\nI'm tired, so let me be broken\\nLook down at the mess that's in front of me\\nNo other words need be spoken\\nAnd I've got nobody else to blame though I tried\\nKept all of our past mistakes held inside\\nI\\u2019ll live with regret for my whole life\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nAll the things you love are all the things I hate\\nHow did we get here in the first place? Oh!\\n\\n[Breakdown]\\nI play it cool, but it's hard to be (All my trust!)\\nIs slowly burning inside of me (Over what?)\\nThere can't be anymore progress, I know our fate\\nThe only thing that can heal this is time and space\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou killed what was left of the good in me\\nI'm tired, so let me be broken\\nLook down at the mess that's in front of me\\nNo other words need be spoken\\nAnd I've got nobody else to blame though I tried\\nKept all of our past mistakes held inside\\nI\\u2019ll live with regret for my whole life\\nFor my whole life!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy\": [\n        \"You Be Tails, I\\u2019ll Be Sonic\",\n        \"A Day To Remember\"\n    ],\n    \"Hope unknown\\nSometimes just waking is surreal\\nI pass right through the nameless ones\\nI know that hope's unknown\\nSometimes the water feels so real\\nAs I walk through it fills my lungs, my god I'm drowning\\n\\n(This day never seems to end)\\nThis pain, never\\n(This day never seems to end)\\nThis rage I cannot let (go)\\n\\nI hear them calling my name (Oh)\\nI feel them gnawing out holes\\nAll throughout my flawless soul\\n\\nI hear them calling my name (Oh)\\nI feel them gnawing out holes (Whoa)\\nAll throughout my flawless soul\\n\\nSo alone\\nSometimes I swear that I can hear\\nThe taunting of the voiceless ones\\nI fear that I alone\\nFear those who finally ceased to feel\\nThat they're alone inside this place, I am the misplaced\\n(This day never seems to end)\\nThis pain, never\\n(This day never seems to end)\\nThis rage I cannot let (go)\\n\\nI hear them calling my name (Oh)\\nI feel them gnawing out holes\\nAll throughout my flawless soul\\n\\nI hear them calling my name (Oh)\\nI feel them gnawing out holes (Whoa)\\nAll throughout my flawless soul\\n\\nNow every face looks familiar\\nFound every face would melt away until now\\nEveryone\\nDo you know?\\nI know your deception\\n\\nNow every face looks familiar\\nFound every face would melt away until now\\nEveryone\\nDo you know?
