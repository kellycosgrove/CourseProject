describe it\\nHaving no time to myself is the only way I can fight it\\nWhen I'm alone it's like I'm staring into a mirror\\nDon't know the person inside it and that's never been any clearer\\nI miss your family and I miss all our friends\\nIf you had it to do over, would you do it over again?\\n'Cause I would, it means something more to me\\nThere's a hole in my heart where you used to be\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nI still wish you the best of luck, baby\\nAnd don't go thinking that this was a waste of time\\nI couldn't forget you if I tried\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou killed what was left of the good in me\\nI'm tired, so let me be broken\\nLook down at the mess that's in front of me\\nNo other words need be spoken\\nAnd I've got nobody else to blame though I tried\\nKept all of our past mistakes held inside\\nI\\u2019ll live with regret for my whole life\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nI confess that I brought this all on myself\\nCondemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else\\nWhen you're gone, it's like a whole part of me\\u2019s missing\\nSo I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening\\nI tried to make us a life here\\nBut our foundation was built on sand\\nNo time to run until the damage was done\\nAnd I\\u2019ve never had the upper hand\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nI still wish you the best of luck, baby\\nAnd don't go thinking that this was a waste of time\\nI couldn't forget you if I tried\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou killed what was left of the good in me\\nI'm tired, so let me be broken\\nLook down at the mess that's in front of me\\nNo other words need be spoken\\nAnd

hate\\nHow did we get here in the first place? Oh!\\n\\n[Breakdown]\\nI play it cool, but it's hard to be (All my trust!)\\nIs slowly burning inside of me (Over what?)\\nThere can't be anymore progress, I know our fate\\nThe only thing that can heal this is time and space\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou killed what was left of the good in me\\nI'm tired, so let me be broken\\nLook down at the mess that's in front of me\\nNo other words need be spoken\\nAnd I've got nobody else to blame though I tried\\nKept all of our past mistakes held inside\\nI\\u2019ll live with regret for my whole life\\nFor my whole life!5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy\": [\n        \"You Be Tails, I\\u2019ll Be Sonic\",\n        \"A Day To Remember\"\n    ]\n}"
