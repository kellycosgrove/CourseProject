missing\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nIf a picture is all that I have\\nI can picture the times that we won't get back\\nIf I picture it now it don't seem so bad\\nEither way, I still wish you were here\\nDon't say

days\\nWhere we all used to say\\n\\\"I know anywhere's better than here\\\"\\nIn the back of the class\\nWhere we grew up too fast\\nLiving life like there's nothing to fear\\nBut the ice on the road\\nDriving home all alone\\nSinging along to a song from three summers ago\\nThe one that made you remember it\\nNow I'll always remember it (I'll always remember it)\\nAs the song that your life ended with\\n[Chorus]\\nIf a picture is all that I have\\nI can picture the times that we won't get back\\nIf I picture it now it don't seem so bad\\nEither way, I still wish you were here\\nDon't say

better place\\nBut a better place is right here with me\\nYeah, they say you're in a better place\\nToo bad it's not what I believe\\n[Chorus 2]\\n'Cause a picture is all that I have\\nTo remind me that you're never coming back\\nIf I picture it now it just makes me sad\\nAnd right now I just wish you were here\\nDon't say everything's meant to be\\n'Cause you know it's not what I believe\\nCan't help but think that it should've been me\\nIn the end, I just wish you were here\\n[Outro]\\nYeah they say you're in a better place\\nEither way, I still wish you were here\\nThey say
