of the Teacher\\nBut mother had sworn he went off to the war\\nAnd died there with honor\\nSomewhere on a beach there\\nBut he left once to never return\\nWhich taught me that I should unlearn\\nWhatever I thought a father should be\\nI abandoned that thought like he abandoned me\\nBy '47, I was fourteen\\nI'd acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine\\nI smoked until I threw

been loved yet myself\\nFrom there it's your typical spiel\\nYeah, if life was a highway, I was drunk at the wheel (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)\\nI was helping the loose ends all fall apart (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)\\nYeah, I swear I was destined to fail, and fail from the start\\nI bowled about six times a week\\nA bottle of Beam kept the memories from me\\nOur marriage had taken a
