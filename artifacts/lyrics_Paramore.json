misspelled band burning their own houses down\\nAnother pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day\\nAnother star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray\\nAnother thorny field to scatter fruitless seed\\nAnother song that runs too long, God knows no one needs\\nMore misguided ghosts, more transparent hands\\nTo drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot! dance\\nBeneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips\\nIn scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships\\nSo throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea\\nAs protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me\\n\\nWhen this repetition ends behind the window shades\\nA semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made\\nThat most unrestful bed, that most original of sins\\nAnd you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again\\nI'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise\\nAnd drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes\\nBack in a cast bit-part, back when I

eyes\\nRealising that what they see may not even be close to the image I see in myself\\nAnd I think I might actually be more afraid to let my own self down than anything else\\nI feel like the man in the story\\nWho saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat\\nTwelve years ago I stood on the shore\\nAnd jumped in and grabbed the coat\\nThe river was rushing toward a waterfall\\nAnd, and my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land\\nI let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me\\nIn any case please let me know if
