spiel\\nYeah, if life was a highway, I was drunk at the wheel (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)\\nI was helping the loose ends all fall apart (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)\\nYeah, I swear I was destined to fail, and fail from the start\\nI bowled about six times a week\\nA bottle of Beam kept the memories from me\\nOur marriage had taken a seven-ten split\\nAnd along with my pride, the ex-wife took the

\"[Intro]\\nIf you\\u2019ve ever been in love\\nOr ever hope to be in love\\nHere\\u2019s a story you\\u2019ll love with all your heart\\n\\n[Verse 1: Jordan Pundik]\\nCouples on their backs in the park\\nLay on blankets bought\\nOn a date the day before\\nA routine I\\u2019ve been longing for\\nCan\\u2019t help but to glance\\nFrom the corner of my resentful eyes\\nGuess it\\u2019s all perspective but\\nIt\\u2019s you I never get enough\\nWe\\u2019re always far apart\\n\\n[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]\\nWe\\u2019ve got a vicious love\\nWe mix our tears with blood\\nNo clock will stop for us\\nIt ticks by\\nWe fight as hard as we love\\nWe\\u2019ve got a vicious love\\n\\n[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]\\nWhen I go out alone\\nAnd see them sharing meals\\nLike Lady and the Tramp\\nHate their loving eyes\\nWishing it was you and I\\nAdd tip to my receipt\\nFold it up behind a picture of us\\nGuess it\\u2019s all perspective but\\nTogether though we rarely touch\\nHard not to fall apart\\n[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]\\nWe\\u2019ve got a vicious love\\nWe mix our tears with blood\\nNo clock will stop for us\\nIt ticks by\\nWe fight as hard as we love\\nWe\\u2019ve got a vicious love\\n\\n[Bridge: Jordan Pundik]\\nI could have given up a thousand times\\nIn the past that was so easy\\nWhen the thought came to my mind\\nThere was no convincing me\\nPlant my feet to face it all\\nSide by side or a phone call\\nLiving in tension with you\\nStill feels better\\nBetter than I\\u2019ve ever known\\n\\n[Chorus: Jordan Pundik & Hayley Williams]\\nWe\\u2019ve got a vicious love\\nWe mix our tears with blood\\nNo clock will stop for us\\nIt ticks by\\nWe fight as hard as we love\\nWe\\u2019ve got a vicious love2EmbedShare
