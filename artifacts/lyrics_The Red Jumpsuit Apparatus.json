again\\nNow it seems I've found some friends who finally understand what it takes\\nTo make this dream come true, we'll be here till the end\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nShake it, break it, get off your feet\\nCome dance with me and don't you fake it\\nShake it, break it get off your feet\\nGet close to me and don't you fake it\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nShout and scream my friends, connect with me and we'll pretend\\nThis night will never end (wo oh) this night will never end\\nJust let go you'll see together we'll do anything\\nThis night will never end (wo oh) this night will never end\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nShake it, break it, get off your feet\\nCome dance with me and don't you fake it\\nShake it, break it get off your feet\\nGet close to me and don't you fake it\\n\\n[Breakdown]\\nOh, wish I could thank you all for what you have done\\nAnd all of the things that you have shared with me\\nOh, wish I could take you all to where I must go wish I could take you all\\nI'll take you in my arms\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nDance, get on the floor, shake, get on the floor, break, get on the floor\\nDance, get on the floor, shake, get on the floor, break, get on the floor\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nShake it, break it, get off your feet\\nCome dance with me and don't you fake it\\nShake it, break it get off your feet\\nGet close to me and don't you fake it\\n\\n[Outro]\\nI'm reaching out here to show you what we've been through\\nI think there's something we can share, that's completely new\\nOr maybe I'm just insane, oh\\nShake it break it get off your feet1EmbedShare
