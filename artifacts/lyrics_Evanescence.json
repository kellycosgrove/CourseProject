you see into my eyes like open doors?\\nLeading you down into my core, where I've become so numb\\nWithout a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold\\nUntil you find it there and lead it back home\\n\\n[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]\\nWake me up, wake me up inside\\nI can't wake up, wake me up inside\\nSave me, call my name and save me from the dark\\nWake me up, bid my blood to run\\nI can't wake up, before I come undone\\nSave me, save me from the nothing I've become\\n\\n[Verse 2: Amy Lee]\\nNow that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me\\nBreathe into me and make me real, bring me to life\\n\\n[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]\\nWake me up, wake me up inside\\nI can't wake up, wake me up inside\\nSave me, call my name and save me from the dark\\nWake me up, bid my blood to run\\nI can't wake up, before I come undone\\nSave me, save me from the nothing I've become\\n[Bridge: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]\\nBring me to life, I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside\\nBring me to life\\nFrozen inside, without your touch, without your love, darling\\nOnly you are the life among the dead\\n\\n[Verse 3: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]\\nAll this time, I can't believe I couldn't see\\nKept in the dark, but you were there in front of me\\nI've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems\\nGot to open my eyes to everything\\nWithout a thought, without a voice, without a soul\\nDon't let me die here\\nThere must be something more\\nBring me to life\\n\\n[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]\\nWake me up, wake me up inside\\nI can't wake up, wake me up inside\\nSave me, call my name and save me from the dark\\nWake me up, bid my blood to run\\nI can't wake up, before I come undone\\nSave me, save me from the nothing I've become\\n\\n[Outro: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]\\nBring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside\\nBring me to life114EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy\": [\n        \"Bring Me to Life\",\n        \"Evanescence\"\n    ]\n}"
